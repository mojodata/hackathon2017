MORE than ten years have elapsed since Alan Greenspan stepped down from the Federal Reserve; a decade that has not been kind to his reputation. Having just read Sebastian Mallaby&#039;s comprehensive biography*, &quot;The Man Who Knew&quot;, it struck me that his career was a classic example of cognitive dissonance. (Read Martin Wolf&#039;s review of the book here.)The main post-crisis criticism of Mr Greenspan was that he was a naive believer in market efficiency, failing to pop bubbles in the late 1990s or mid-2000s and failing to regulate the financial sector properly. He was, for a while, a disciple of the libertarian novelist, Ayn Rand. But Mr Mallaby shows that things were rather more complex than that characterisation suggests.In a paper written back in 1959, for example, Mr Greenspan clearly seemed to understand the detrimental effect that bubbles could have. He wrote thatThe higher the stock market gets at its peak and hence the greater decline required to return to &quot;normal&quot;, the deeper the decline in economic activity&amp;nbsp;In 2002, after the Enron scandal, Greenspan also spoke in favour of greater regulation of corporate accounting standards. Smacking the table, he told a meeting thatThere is too much gaming of the system until it is broke. Capitalism is not working.&amp;nbsp;It is pretty clear that Mr ...]]></description>

IN THE Bible, seven years of feast were followed by seven years of famine. For banks there have been ten lean years. Subprime-loan defaults started to rise in February 2007, causing a near-collapse of the industry in America and Europe. Next came bail-outs from governments, then years of grovelling before regulators, mass firings of staff and quarter after quarter of poor results that left banks’ shareholders disappointed. Now, a decade later, the moneylenders are quietly wondering if 2017 is the year in which their industry turns a corner.
Over the past six months ...]]></description>

SOME banks find existing capital requirements too taxing. To no one’s surprise, on December 23rd Monte dei Paschi di Siena, at present Italy’s fourth-biggest bank, asked the Italian state for help, having failed to raise from the private sector €5bn ($5.2bn) in capital demanded by the European Central Bank before the year’s end. Three days later Monte dei Paschi said that the ECB had redone its sums—and concluded that the stricken lender faced an even bigger shortfall, of €8.8bn.
Plenty of other European banks—in far better nick than poor old Monte dei Paschi, which is ...]]></description>

FOR months, a bail-out had seemed likely; for weeks, unavoidable. On December 23rd it became fact. Monte dei Paschi di Siena, Italy’s third-largest bank and Europe’s most troubled, announced it had requested state help. The European Central Bank (ECB), Monte dei Paschi’s supervisor, had given it until the end of the year to find €5bn ($5.2bn) in equity, but the bank’s attempts to raise the money from the private sector failed. Paolo Gentiloni, Italy’s new prime minister, said that “today represents a turning-point [for the bank] and a reassurance for its depositors and its future”.
That is the hope. The Tuscan lender’s problems have been rumbling for years. In 2007 it ill-advisedly bought Antonveneta, another Italian bank, from Spain’s Santander for €9bn in cash; more tales of mismanagement have emerged since. Monte dei Paschi has already had two state bail-outs, and raised €8bn from share issues in 2014 and 2015. Its gross non-performing ...]]></description>

WELL, it might have been worse. Early on December 23rd Deutsche Bank announced that it had reached a settlement “in principle” with America’s Department of Justice (DoJ), over claims that it had mis-sold residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBSs) in 2005-07, in the run-up to the financial crisis. Deutsche says the agreement is worth $7.2bn—a far cry from the $14bn that the DoJ demanded in September, sending Deutsche’s share price reeling. Credit Suisse said that it too had struck a deal, worth $5.3bn. However, the DoJ is suing Barclays, with which it had also been negotiating, and two of its bankers. Barclays says it will fight the complaint.
Deutsche, Germany’s biggest bank, has always insisted that it would not pay anything like as much as the DoJ had asked for. Although $7.2bn is more than analysts had expected, investors will probably see the deal as good news: Deutsche will fork out only—“only”—$3.1bn in cash and pay the rest as “consumer relief”, such as changes to borrowers’ loans, which will be spread over five ...]]></description>

THIS is no time to be timid. Or so Jean-Pierre Mustier seems to think. On December 13th, after five months in the job, the chief executive of UniCredit presented his plan for Italy’s biggest bank. He didn’t hold back. UniCredit is shedding €17.7bn worth ($18.8bn) of bad loans, taking a one-off provision of €8.1bn. It will save €1.7bn a year by 2019, cutting 6,500 jobs on top of 7,500 previously announced to shrink its workforce by 14%. And in a rights issue next year it will raise €13bn—just €2bn less than its market value before the announcement. The markets lapped it up: the shares gained 16%, before retreating the next day.

THE first casualty was Matteo Renzi’s hold on office. As he had promised, Italy’s prime minister resigned on December 7th, three days after voters rejected his proposals to overhaul the constitution. The second is likely to be a planned private-sector recapitalisation of Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena, the country’s third-biggest bank and the world’s oldest. As The Economist went to press, the scheme’s chances looked slim. A government rescue was reportedly being prepared.
Monte dei Paschi has been in trouble for years. It has already had two state bail-outs and ...]]></description>

A STEEP climb awaited the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in Santiago on November 28th and 29th. The central bankers and regulators hoped to agree on revisions to Basel 3, the post-crisis version of bank-capital standards. On November 30th Stefan Ingves, the group’s chairman and head of Sweden’s central bank, said that “the contours of an agreement are now clear”. But the climbers are still short of the summit.
The committee had proposed restricting the use of banks’ internal models for calculating risk-weighted assets—which in turn help determine how much capital banks must have at hand. Models varied too much, it said; low ...]]></description>

Stockmarkets in America remained buoyant as investors anticipated that Donald Trump’s presidency will reduce regulations and boost growth. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&amp;amp;P 500 and NASDAQ share indices rose to new record highs on the same day, with the Dow closing above the 19,000 mark for the first time. Investors also focused on whether OPEC members will agree to cut oil production, and thus lift oil prices (and oil-industry profits), at their forthcoming meeting. See article.&amp;nbsp;

An annual ranking of systemically important global banks was published by the Financial Stability Board, an international regulatory body. It ranks 30 banks based on the risk they would present to the world economy if they went bankrupt.

SINCE Donald Trump won the election, American bank shares have surged on traders’ hopes of a bonfire of financial regulations. So a proposal from Neel Kashkari, head of the Minneapolis Federal Reserve, vastly to increase capital requirements looks ill-timed. On the other hand, the plan mimics the direction—if not the extent—of one backed by congressional Republicans.
Mr Kashkari is an experienced financial firefighter. An alumnus of Goldman Sachs, best-connected of investment ...]]></description>

THE fines paid to America’s financial regulators by errant bankers vary enormously these days: from sky-high to stratospheric. Deutsche Bank is fighting a demand for $14bn. BNP Paribas paid $9bn last year for facilitating the evasion of American sanctions. So eyebrows were raised at the final settlement disclosed this month between the state-controlled Agricultural Bank of China (ABC) and New York’s Department of Financial Services (DFS).

FROM the mists of Italian banking, new shapes are emerging. One is at last becoming flesh: on October 15th the shareholders of two lenders, Banco Popolare and Banca Popolare di Milano, approved a merger that has been months in the making. The substance of another—Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena, the world’s oldest bank as well as Italy’s most troubled—is still shrouded, but it is likely to become clearer at a meeting of Monte dei Paschi’s board on October 24th.
The merged bank, to be ...]]></description>

QUEASY calm is unpleasant, but it beats sickening panic. Late on September 29th Deutsche Bank’s share price lurched downwards again, to a 34-year low, after Bloomberg reported that “about ten” hedge funds had switched some business away from the troubled German lender. That capped a stomach-churning fortnight, after America’s Department of Justice (DoJ) requested $14 billion to settle claims that Deutsche mis-sold residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBSs) before the financial crisis. Hopes that it might settle with the DOJ for $5 billion-odd, though so far unfulfilled, have since brought uneasy respite. On October 5th Deutsche’s shares were some 20% above their nadir.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 





A swift, affordable agreement would end uncertainty about the bill and quieten chatter, pooh-poohed by government and bank, that the German state might have to prop up the country’s biggest lender. It would also buy breathing space. ...]]></description>

FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT quipped that “the modern city is a place for banking and prostitution and very little else.” Little did the early 20th-century architect know how banks would flourish, hoovering up much of the world’s talent by the early 2000s. But this golden age is ending: bankers’ jobs are at risk from the digital revolution on the one hand, and falling profits on the other.
Nowhere have bankers fallen from grace with such a bump as in Europe. This week ING, the Netherlands’ largest bank, announced that up to 7,000 jobs would be cut in the next five years. Commerzbank, Germany’s second-largest bank, had already reported it would cut its workforce by 9,600, nearly a fifth.





Across Europe, bankers are packing up. In Britain more than 10% of bank jobs were cut between 2011 and 2015; in Germany the workforce has shrunk by around 20% since 2001. Since the start of the year Credit Suisse has got rid of nearly 5,000 ...]]></description>

IT MUST have been an exquisite moment. On September 30th the central bank in Athens issued a statement reassuring investors that the Greek banking system was safe—from a crisis engulfing Germany’s flagship bank. Any Schadenfreude felt in Europe’s periphery at Deutsche Bank’s tumbling shares should be stifled, however. Deutsche is not about to fail: it can survive a harsh funding squeeze, its solvency is not in doubt and if push came to shove, the German government would surely support it. But many of its woes are symptomatic of problems that bedevil the whole continent.
Plenty would deny that. Deutsche is more leveraged than its peers; it is unusual in lacking a crown jewel around which it can base a business model; and it has a stack of derivatives whose prices are hard to observe in the market. More positively, it is light on the non-performing loans that clog the balance-sheets of banks in places like Italy. But in other ways its problems have a very familiar ring. Deutsche is struggling to make a decent return. It has taken ...]]></description>

When main trading ended in Frankfurt on Thursday, Deutsche Bank’s shares were 1% up on the day—cause for quiet relief in another jittery week. At close of play in New York four and a half hours later, they were 6.7% down. The catalyst: a Bloomberg report saying that “about ten” hedge funds that use Deutsche’s prime brokerage had moved part of their derivatives holdings elsewhere, to reduce their exposure to Germany’s biggest lender.
Bloomberg noted that “the vast majority” of clients had not budged. Deutsche responded that it was “confident that the vast majority of them have a full understanding of our stable financial position”. But the news dealt another blow to Deutsche’s already battered shares, which have been plumbing 33-year lows. Deutsche has been reeling for a fortnight, since receiving a request for $14 billion from America’s Department of Justice (DoJ) to settle claims that it mis-sold residential-mortgage-backed securities between 2005 and 2007.
A $14 billion legal bill would blow a sizeable hole in ...]]></description>

BILLS for pre-crisis buccaneering are still coming in. Deutsche Bank, Germany’s biggest lender, confirmed on September 15th that America’s Department of Justice (DoJ) had asked for $14 billion to settle possible claims connected with the underwriting and sale of residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBSs) between 2005 and 2007. The next day Deutsche’s share price, already reeling after a wretched year, plunged by 8%. It was groggier still after the weekend, closing on September 20th at a 30-year low (see chart).





American banks have settled with the DoJ for amounts between $3.2 billion (Morgan Stanley) and $16.7 billion (Bank of America), as well as agreeing on smaller sums with the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), another regulator. Deutsche, which settled with the FHFA for $1.9 billion in 2013, insists that it will not pay anything near to what the DoJ has asked for, and it surely won’t. Citigroup, which reached an ...]]></description>

“DEUTSCHE BANK has no intent to settle these potential civil claims anywhere near the number cited.” Shock may explain the rickety syntax. On September 16th Germany’s largest bank confirmed reports that America’s Department of Justice had asked for $14 billion to settle possible claims connected with the underwriting and sale of residential-mortgage-backed securities (RMBSs) between 2005 and 2007. Deutsche’s share price, already hovering close to record lows after a wretched year, plunged by more than 8%. So did those of other European banks yet to agree terms with the DoJ over RMBSs. Royal Bank of Scotland’s shares dropped by 4.4% and Credit Suisse’s by 4%; Barclays and UBS shed 2%-plus.
American banks have settled with the department for amounts between $3.2 billion (Morgan Stanley) and $16.7 billion (Bank of America), as well as paying smaller sums to the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), another regulator. Analysts had expected Deutsche’s penalty to be at the bottom of that range, or even below it. Deutsche, ...]]></description>

                    Rising LIBOR        
        










DURING the financial crisis of 2008, LIBOR was a gauge of fear. The London inter-bank offered rate—at which banks are willing to lend to one another—leapt. (Even then it may have been too reassuring: banks have since been fined billions, and traders jailed, for rigging it.) Lately it has been climbing again: on August 22nd three-month dollar LIBOR rose above 0.82%. That is no cause for panic, but it is a seven-year high and 0.2 percentage points more than in June. What’s going on?
Increases in LIBOR, a benchmark used to set rates for trillions of dollars’ worth of loans, usually reflect either strains on banks or expected rises in central banks’ policy rates. Although the Federal Reserve has been toying with tightening, this time LIBOR’s ascent has another explanation, traceable to the turmoil of 2008. A change by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the regulation of American money-market funds has made borrowing pricier, especially for foreign banks.

AFTER years of economic stagnation and questionable lending, bad loans at Italian banks have piled up. The gross value of non-performing loans (NPLs) is around €360 billion ($406 billion), or almost one-fifth of Italian GDP. Hasty repairs and rescues have been arranged for troubled lenders—notably Monte dei Paschi di Siena, the third-biggest, in July. But what can be done about the loan mountain?
The IMF has suggested building a robust market in NPLs, thus placing the burden of bad loans with distressed-debt specialists, freeing Italian banks to provide more credit to the real economy. But although the market for bad debts has started to pick up in Italy, with volumes increasing steadily to reach €22 billion so far this year, structural obstacles mean such markets may be less successful than in other European countries.

THE most dramatic moment of the global financial crisis of the late 2000s was the collapse of Lehman Brothers on September 15th 2008. The point at which the drama became inevitable, though—the crossroads on the way to Thebes—came two years earlier, in the summer of 2006. That August house prices in America, which had been rising almost without interruption for as long as anyone could remember, began to fall—a fall that went on for 31 months (see chart 1). In early 2007 mortgage defaults spiked and a mounting panic gripped Wall Street. The money markets dried up as banks became too scared to lend to each other. The lenders with the largest losses and smallest capital buffers began to topple. Thebes fell to the plague.





Ten years on, and America’s banks have been remade to withstand such disasters. When Jamie Dimon, the boss of JPMorgan Chase, talks of its “fortress” balance-sheet, he has a point. The banking ...]]></description>

ANY big announcement about banks made after the markets close for the weekend is bound to bring back dark memories of the 2007-08 financial crisis. Although the results of the latest European bank stress tests, released on July 29th, contained much that was reassuring, they did not dispel investors’ doubts about the industry’s earnings prospects. And in the case of Italy, the tests seemed to exacerbate bigger worries. When the markets opened again on August 1st, they were marked by falls in banks’ share prices; the Euro Stoxx banks index dropped by 3% and almost 5% on successive days.
In aggregate the results suggested that European banks were in a healthier position than when the last exercise was conducted, in autumn 2014. This time the banks began with an average “fully-loaded” capital ratio of 12.6% and ended with one of 9.2% in the tests’ most adverse scenario; that compares with a fall from 11.1% to 7.6% last time. No country’s banking sector ended the tests with an average capital ratio below the 5.2% of Ireland; in ...]]></description>

Not exactly Silicon Valley

FEW companies are able to go public with a valuation of more than $50 billion less than a decade after their founding. This rarefied group, which mainly consists of tech darlings, is about to admit a surprising new member: a large, lumbering Chinese bank. Postal Savings Bank of China, established in 2007, is on course for an initial public offering (IPO) this year that is expected to be the world’s biggest for nearly two years. Its pitch to prospective investors is also unusual. Far from boasting about how well it is run, it instead emphasises the advantages of scale—which it has so far squandered—to imply that it has vast untapped potential.
Describing Postal Savings Bank as a startup is something of a misnomer. When it launched nine years ago, it was a spin-off from the Chinese postal service, ...]]></description>

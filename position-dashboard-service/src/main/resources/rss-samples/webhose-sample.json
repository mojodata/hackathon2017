LOUIS , Dec. 30, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Peabody Energy today announced that as of 5:00 p.m. , New York City time, on Dec. 30, 2016 , additional eligible holders of approximately 16.6 percent of the outstanding principal amount of the company's senior secured second lien notes and approximately 3.8 percent of the outstanding principal amount of the company's senior unsecured notes became parties to the Plan Support Agreement (PSA) relating to the company's plan of reorganization and also joined the Backstop Commitment Agreement (BCA) relating to the proposed $750 million common stock rights offering and the Private Placement Agreement (PPA) relating to the proposed private placement of $750 million of mandatorily convertible preferred stock as Phase Two parties.\nWhen combined with the holdings of the creditors party to the PSA, BCA and PPA through Dec. 29, 2016 , holders of approximately 40.1 percent of the company's outstanding first lien debt are parties to the PSA, and holders of approximately 81.9 percent of the outstanding principal amount of the company's senior secured second lien notes and 72.3 percent of the outstanding principal amount of the company's senior unsecured notes are parties to each of the PSA, BCA and PPA.\n\"Peabody is pleased with the continued momentum demonstrated by the substantial consensus shown among multiple creditor classes,\" says Peabody President and Chief Executive Officer Glenn Kellow . \"We look forward to advancing our plan toward approval and ultimate confirmation.\"\nThe plan of reorganization is subject to confirmation by the court, and the related disclosure statement is subject to approval by the court. This press release is not intended as solicitation for a vote on the plan. The full terms of the plan of reorganization and disclosure statement, as well as the related motions and other documentation relating to the Chapter 11 cases, are available online at http://www.kccllc.net/Peabody .\nPeabody Energy is the world's largest private-sector coal company and a Fortune 500 company. The company serves metallurgical and thermal coal customers in 25 countries on six continents. For further information, visit PeabodyEnergy.com.\nCertain statements included in this release are forward-looking as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The Company uses words such as \"anticipate,\" \"believe,\" \"expect,\" \"may,\" \"forecast,\" \"project,\" \"should,\" \"estimate,\" \"plan,\" \"outlook,\" \"target,\" \"likely,\" \"will,\" \"to be\" or other similar words to identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are made as of the date the release was filed and are based on numerous assumptions that the Company believes are reasonable, but these assumptions are open to a wide range of uncertainties and business risks that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. These factors are difficult to accurately predict and may be beyond the Company's control. Factors that could affect the Company's results include, but are not limited to: the Company's ability to obtain bankruptcy court approval with respect to motions or other requests made to the bankruptcy court in connection with the Company's voluntary petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the U.S. Code (the Chapter 11 Cases), including maintaining strategic control as debtor-in-possession; the Company's ability to negotiate, develop, confirm and consummate a plan of reorganization; the effects of the Chapter 11 Cases on the operations of the Company, including customer, supplier, banking, insurance and other relationships and agreements; bankruptcy court rulings in the Chapter 11 Cases as well as the outcome of all other pending litigation and the outcome of the Chapter 11 Cases in general; the length of time that the Company will operate under Chapter 11 protection and the continued availability of operating capital during the pendency of the proceedings; risks associated with third-party motions in the Chapter 11 Cases, which may interfere with the Company's ability to confirm and consummate a plan of reorganization and restructuring generally; increased advisory costs to execute a plan of reorganization; the impact of the New York Stock Exchange's delisting of the Company's common stock on the liquidity and market price of the Company's common stock and on the Company's ability to access the public capital markets; the volatility of the trading price of the Company's common stock and the absence of correlation between any increases in the trading price and the Company's expectation that the common stock will be cancelled and extinguished upon confirmation of a proposed plan of reorganization with no payments made to the holders of the Company's common stock; the Company's ability to continue as a going concern including the Company's ability to confirm a plan of reorganization that restructures the Company's debt obligations to address liquidity issues and allow emergence from the Chapter 11 Cases; the risk that the plan of reorganization may not be accepted or confirmed, in which case there can be no assurance that the Chapter 11 cases will continue rather than be converted to Chapter 7 liquidation cases or that any alternative plan of reorganization would be on terms as favorable to holders of claims and interests as the terms of the plan of reorganization filed by the Company; the Company's ability to use cash collateral; the effect of the Chapter 11 Cases on the Company's relationships with third parties, regulatory authorities and employees; the potential adverse effects of the Chapter 11 Cases on the Company's liquidity, results of operations, or business prospects; the Company's ability to execute its business and restructuring plan; increased administrative and legal costs related to the Chapter 11 Cases and other litigation and the inherent risks involved in a bankruptcy process; the cost, availability and access to capital and financial markets, including the ability to secure new financing after emerging from the Chapter 11 Cases; the risk that the Chapter 11 Cases will disrupt or impede the Company's international operations, including the Company's business operations in Australia ; competition in the coal industry and supply and demand for the Company's coal products, including the impact of alternative energy sources, such as natural gas and renewables, global steel demand and the downstream impact on metallurgical coal prices, and lower demand for the Company's products by electric power generators; the Company's ability to successfully consummate planned divestitures, including the planned sale of the Metropolitan Mine; the Company's ability to appropriately secure its obligations for reclamation, federal and state workers' compensation, federal coal leases and other obligations related to the Company's operations, including its ability to utilize self-bonding and/or successfully access the commercial surety bond market; customer procurement practices and contract duration; the impact of weather and natural disasters on demand, production and transportation; reductions and/or deferrals of purchases by major customers and the Company's ability to renew sales contracts; credit and performance risks associated with customers, suppliers, contract miners, co-shippers, and trading, bank and other financial counterparties; geologic, equipment, permitting, site access, operational risks and new technologies related to mining; transportation availability, performance and costs; availability, timing of delivery and costs of key supplies, capital equipment or commodities such as diesel fuel, steel, explosives and tires; impact of take-or-pay arrangements for rail and port commitments for the delivery of coal; successful implementation of business strategies, including, without limitation, the actions the Company is implementing to improve its organization and respond to current industry conditions; negotiation of labor contracts, employee relations and workforce availability, including, without limitation, attracting and retaining key personnel; the Company's ability to comply with financial and other restrictive covenants in various agreements; changes in postretirement benefit and pension obligations and their related funding requirements; replacement and development of coal reserves; effects of changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates (primarily the Australian dollar); effects of acquisitions or divestitures; economic strength and political stability of countries in which the Company has operations or serves customers; legislation, regulations and court decisions or other government actions, including, but not limited to, new environmental and mine safety requirements, changes in income tax regulations, sales-related royalties, or other regulatory taxes and changes in derivative laws and regulations; the Company's ability to obtain and renew permits necessary for the Company's operations; litigation or other dispute resolution, including, but not limited to, claims not yet asserted; any additional liabilities or obligations that the Company may have as a result of the bankruptcy of Patriot Coal Corporation, including, without limitation, as a result of litigation filed by third parties in relation to that bankruptcy; terrorist attacks or security threats, including, but not limited to, cybersecurity threats; impacts of pandemic illnesses; and other risks detailed in the Company's reports filed with the SEC. The Company does not undertake to update its forward-looking statements except as required by law. As outlined in the plan of reorganization, our equity securities will be cancelled and extinguished upon confirmation of a plan of reorganization by the bankruptcy court, and holders thereof will not be entitled to receive, and will not receive or retain, any property or interest in property on account of such equity interests.\nCONTACT:\nVic Svec\n314.342.7768\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/peabody-energy-provides-further-update-regarding-plan-of-reorganization-300384321.html\nSOURCE Peabody Energy\n ",

      "text": "Shantae is RET-2-GO once again, finally making her console debut! If you've played any of the previous games, you will be right at home with the mechanics, such as dance transformations and Shantae's \"monster-whipper\" hair. I'll go over the major stuff here.\nSTYLE: As always, WF's passion is clear in every frame of animation-- moving from sprites to art, the revamped style essentially removes the pixelation and allows each character to move and sway like they are popping out of the screen. Hair and clothing moves with such fluidity, it looks like a playable cartoon. Mr Kaufman's enthusiasm is woven into every song, no matter how small its role. Shantae does her classic \"determined butt wiggle\" when crouched, and her dance animations are smooth as butter.\nWRITING: Classic WayForward writing-- clever quips (and more of them voiced than its predecessor!), jokes that will actually make you laugh, and fun characters that are incompetent in a sort of Looney Tunes way, where you are given the impression this kind of silliness happens in their world on a very regular basis. This is a game where (for example) a villain sticks fish onto human girls and cans them, to sell to monsters as a cheaper alternative to mermaid meat. The game's logic asks politely not to be questioned too much-- and you won't mind indulging.\nCOMBAT: If you were hoping for more of the breakneck speed of Pirate's Curse, you may have to wait until the upcoming \"Risky Boots\" mode is released-- Shantae is back to her old-school half-genie self (no pirate gear), with transformations and more focus on platforming. (Sadly, no more scimitar shinesparking.) Although, if you thought PC was too easy, this might entice you! The challenge is ramped up a little, enemy attacks require a little more finesse to dodge, and the bosses (of which there are quite a few!) often take up the entire screen and have some puzzle/platforming element to them. Overall it's a perfectly fine blend of refined elements from past titles-- I just wish there were more stylish ways to get around levels, like the scimitar in PC.\nITEMS: Most of the items we know and love return, like the Pike Balls and Hair Cream and all that, along with new stuff. The game is unusually generous with its currency as well. I was able to buy armor that cuts ALL damage in HALF for just 250 gems at the very start of the game-- rather nice of them. You can also collect Shantae concept art for the town art gallery.\nPLATFORMING: The game asks you to make use of all Shantae's genie abilities in equal measure-- Transformations enable new ways to explore older stages! Spider climbs ceilings, monkey climbs walls, etc. The levels themselves are clearly designed for this, although on your first run of each new area, it may annoy you seeing so many inaccessible places and chests that you have to come back to later.\nSAVING: While I am a longtime Shantae fan, some decisions in this game perplex me greatly. Save wizards, a staple of the series, are now silent black transition screens that stop the bombastic Kaufmann score and ask you to save. This would be fine, if not for a few details; in prior games you could run past these save points-- music also played while in save transition rooms. Now, music tracks are stopped dead to silently offer a save (after nearly every screen transition too!), only to start up again after. I feel like they were trying to streamline saving with this feature, but I vastly preferred the organic save rooms of prior Shantae titles. I think the amount of saving is also a bit excessive even for casual players. If they were going to shove saving down the player's throat this way, then why not just make it an auto-save? Kinda strange.\nMUSIC: Ahh... the shining crown of any WayForward game; another fantastic OST by Jake Kaufmann. Every single track knocks it out of the park-- to the point where some songs feel TOO good to be crammed where they are. As an example, Sky's Hatchery theme is a wonderful, soothing bit of jazz, most of which you won't hear unless you deliberately linger there. Many tracks are either too long to even fully start up in the spaces they're put, or jarringly loud after the dead silence of save prompts. (It feels like an affront to his work to have so many great songs abruptly cut off by saving!)\nBONUSES: Collectibles, concept art, and an extra playable character (with a third to come soon).\nOVERALL: If you love Shantae, this is more of her, and with better audio/visuals than ever before! For $30, you seriously can't go wrong with this. Good for girls or boys-- very kid-friendly dialogue and monster designs that range from adorable to awe-inspiring. For the visual polish and music alone I would argue this is a must buy-- if you've played a lot of Shantae before, this might feel like a more compact and streamlined game compared to the 12-15 hour Pirate's Curse, but it's no less rich in charm. 4/5. stars: 4",

      "text": "5 \"In a few hours, we will be ushering in the new year of 2017. 125 crore Indians will join the rest of the world, in welcoming it with new hope, new energy and new dreams,\" said Prime Minister Narendra Modi as per the released English text of PM's address to the nation on the eve of New Year 2017. Much later in the address Modi added \"Friends, to further the principle of Sabka Saath – Sabka Vikaas, on the eve of the new year, Government is bringing some new programmes for the people.\" \"My effort is to take the banking system to normalcy as fast as possible in the New Year. I have asked all concerned officers in the government to focus their attention to this task. They have especially been told to proactively resolve the problems in rural and remote areas,\" he assured. \"According to information with the government, there are only 24 lakh people in India who accept that their annual income is more than 10 lakh rupees. Can we digest this? Look at the big bungalows and big cars around you,\" he said pointing out the prevent dishonesty in the society and urged the dishonest to return to the path of goodness. He pointed out that terrorism, Naxalism, Maoism, counterfeit currency trade, drug trade, human trafficking were dependent on black money and had become a festering sore on society and Governments. He told that his government has taken some major decisions to ensure homes for the poor, the neo middle class and the middle class and informed that under the Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana in rural areas, is being increased by 33 per cent. The government has taken care to ensure that farmers do not suffer for want of access to seeds, fertilisers and credit. Now, we have taken some more decisions in the interest of farmers. The government has decided, that 3 crore farmers who have Kisan Credit Cards, will be given RuPay debit cards within three months. Kisan Credit Cards were launched in 1998, but so far, it was essential to go to a bank, to use them. Now, farmers will have RuPay Debit Cards, which they can use anywhere. He listed out some recent action of his government and said that it has ... -taken decisions in the interest of small and medium businesses, which will also boost employment. -asked banks to raise the credit limit for small industry from 20 per cent of turnover to 25 per cent...and increase working capital loans from 20 per cent of turnover to 30 per cent, for enterprises that transact digitally. -launched a scheme for pregnant women for financial assistance to pregnant women. 6,000 rupees will be transferred directly to the bank accounts of pregnant women who undergo institutional delivery and vaccinate their children -extended a fixed interest rate of 8 per cent for a period of 10 years, on deposits up to 7.5 lakh rupees for which the interest would be paid monthly. He urged political parties and their leaders to move away from a \"holier than thou approach,\" to come together in prioritising transparency, and take firm steps to free politics of black money and corruption. He batted for simultaneous conduct of state and national elections to reduce election expenditure, and minimize pressure on the administrative machinery. Ending his address, Modi said, \"As a nation, India's villages, poor, farmers, youth, educated and uneducated men and women, have all displayed infinite patience and people power. In a short time, the new year of 2017 will begin. The new dawn of the New Year, comes with the resolve of new success. Let us all come together, to move ahead overcoming obstacles and constraints. Happy New Year. Jai Hind !!!\" In Focus",

      "text": "Demonetisation paves way for cut in corporate tax: CII IANS Narendra Modi (file photo) \n\nDemonetisation of high value currency notes has paved the way for cutting corporate income tax in the forthcoming union budget 2017-18, industry chamber said on Sunday. \nThe Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) said this in a statement following expiry of the deadline to deposit old Rs 500 and 1,000 notes in banks.\"With a larger share of the economy captured in the tax net, the government has greater space to lower corporate income tax rates. In our recommendations for budget 2017-18, the CII has called for reducing the corporate income tax rate to 18 per cent, including all surcharges and cess, along with removal of all tax incentives and concessions,\" CII Director General Chandrajit Banerjee said here.\"Going by experience, it is found that a lower tax rate encourages higher compliance. We believe that lowering the tax rate to 18 per cent and removing all tax exemptions will not negatively impact the government revenues on this head,\" he said. \"CII notes that there are 32 incentives applicable on corporate profits before calculating tax. The effective tax rate works out to about 19.8 per cent,\" the statement said. It said that in its pre-budget suggestions to the Finance Ministry, the CII has requested a four-pronged strategy for strengthening economic activity by reducing corporate income tax rate, revival of investments, creation of better quality jobs in the formal sector, and a national technology strategy with a \"ten-fold increase in public investment in research in higher education institutions\".\"A National Innovation Fund with a corpus of at least Rs 10,000 crore should be set up, using Rs 8,000 crore collected through cess on technology imports,\" it said. loading...",

      "title": "Revelers bid adieu to 2016 | Chatham Daily News",
      "text": "\nAs 2016 draws to a close, revelers around the world are bidding a weary adieu to a year filled with political surprises, prolonged conflicts and deaths of legendary celebrities. \nHow people are ushering in the new year: \nAUSTRALIA \nSydney sent up a dazzling tribute to 2016’s fallen icons with a New Year’s Eve fireworks display honouring the late singer David Bowie and late actor Gene Wilder, becoming the first major city to bid a bittersweet adieu to a turbulent year. \nThe glittering display over Sydney’s famed harbour and bridge featured Saturn and star-shaped fireworks set to “Space Oddity,” the classic song by Bowie — one of the seemingly endless parade of beloved entertainers who died in 2016. \nWilder was also honoured as the bridge lit up in a rainbow of colours while a song from Wilder’s famed film “Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory” played. \n“This year, sadly, we saw the loss of many music and entertainment legends around the world,” fireworks show co-producer Catherine Flanagan said. “So celebrating their music as part of Sydney New Year’s Eve fireworks displays is an opportunity to reflect on the year that has been and what the future may hold.” \n——— \nLAS VEGAS \nMore than 300,000 visitors are expected to descend on Las Vegas for an extravagant New Year’s Eve celebration. \nNightclubs are pulling out all the stops with performances from DJ Calvin Harris, rappers T-Pain and Kendrick Lamar and artists Drake and Bruno Mars. The city’s celebrity chefs have crafted elaborate prix fixe menus complete with caviar and champagne toasts. \nAn eight-minute fireworks show will kick off at the stroke of midnight, with rockets launching from the tops of half a dozen casinos. \nFederal officials have ranked the celebration just below the Super Bowl and on par with the festivities in Times Square. FBI and Secret Service agents will work alongside local police departments that are putting all hands on deck for the big night. \n——— \nGERMANY \nIn Berlin the mood was more sombre than celebratory. \n“I don’t like the way politics is going,” said Daniel Brandt. “Fears are being fanned and people are so angry with each other.” \nThe tone of public debate in Germany has become shriller over the past two years with the influx of hundreds of thousands of migrants. \nTwo Israeli tourists, on a visit to the German capital, seemed at a loss when asked about their wishes for 2017. “Peace on Earth. Just happiness, really,” said Nathan and Libat, declining to give their last names. \nWalking by the Reichstag, Germany’s Parliament building, Hamed Noori said 2016 had been a good year. “I came to Germany from Afghanistan,” he said. “Life is better here.” \nBirgitta Bergquist, a recent retiree visiting Berlin from Sweden, said she looked forward to spending more time with her three-year-old granddaughter. “And we hope the family stays healthy.” \nNicole Durand-Nusser, originally from France but living in Berlin for almost 50 years, said 2016 had been a difficult year: “Brexit, Trump, Erdogan — it’s all getting worse. \n“I’m a convinced European and I hope Europe doesn’t collapse in 2017,” she said. \nLater, police said they arrested a man who shouted “bomb, bomb, bomb” at Berlin’s massive open-air New Year’s party. \nUsing the hashtag “#nichtlustig”— meaning “not funny”— Berlin police tweeted Saturday that the unnamed man “is now celebrating #Welcome2017 with us.” \n——— \nTURKEY \nNeslihan Dogruol, a restaurant owner in a chic Istanbul neighbourhood, said she hopes for peace in 2017 following a year filled with “unrest and death.” \n“2016 affected everyone badly,” she said, referring to major attacks that hit Turkey in the past year. \nThe restaurant, adorned with snowflakes and tiny decorative lights for the evening, will have fewer people for dinner. “There is a serious gap between 2015 and 2016 in terms of business, people are going out less,” Dogruol said, adding that she expects more people to come for drinks. \nAt a commemoration for the 45 people killed in twin bombings on Dec. 10 in Istanbul, 38-year-old Murat Manoglu hoped for a better year ahead. “We lived through terrible days, we have lost many martyrs, many households suffered,” he said. \nSecurity measures were heightened in major Turkish cities. Traffic leading up to key squares in Istanbul and the capital, Ankara, will be closed, police said. In Istanbul, 17,000 police officers were on duty, some camouflaged as Santa Claus and others as street vendors, Turkey’s state-run Anadolu news agency reported on Friday. \nAnkara and Istanbul were targeted by bomb attacks in 2016, killing more than 180 people. Turkey has been in the throes of violence, combating the Islamic State group, Kurdish militants and a coup attempt blamed on the U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen. \n——— \nRUSSIA \nPresident Vladimir Putin invoked a bit of seasonal enchantment in his New Year’s Eve remarks to the nation. \n“Each of us may become something of a magician on the night of the New Year,” Putin said in a short televised address broadcast in the closing minutes of 2016 in each of Russia’s 11 time zones. \n“To do this we simply need to treat our parents with love and gratitude, take care of our children and families, respect our colleagues at work, nurture our friendships, defend truth and justice, be merciful and help those who are in need of support. This is the whole secret,” he said. \nNew Year’s Eve is Russia’s major gift-giving holiday, and big Russian cities were awash in festive lights and decorations. The Moscow subway offered a special holiday train, festooned with lights and artificial greenery. \n“I wish for the next year to better than this,” said rider Alexander Pisaryev. \n“We are waiting for good, for peace and order,” said another, Valentina Daineka. \n——— \nPARIS \nTourists and French revelers swarmed along Paris’ illuminated Champs Elysees Avenue on a frosty night, admiring the laser display from the Arc de Triomphe and lines of trees sparkling with lights. \n“It’s so magical to be here in Paris, on what people say is the world’s most beautiful avenue,” said Maureen O’Reilly, 42, a visitor from Belfast, Northern Ireland. \n“At times like this, I do think about all those terrible things in Aleppo and how lucky we are here in Europe despite everything,” she added. \nSome were happy to say goodbye to 2016. \n“It’s been such a horrible year, with all these (entertainment celebrity) deaths, Syria, Brexit and Trump. I say: good riddance,” said Karine Dublot, 38, from Lyon. \nOthers found a bright side. \n“My hope for 2017 is that we solve all the problems with the migrants here in France, and see the end of (President) Francois Hollande,” said Marc Valli, 35, from Paris. “We need someone who can sort out immigration as president.” \nHollande, who is not standing for re-election in the upcoming ballot, used his last New Year’s address to praise his country’s resilience in the face of deadly attacks in Nice and Saint-Etienne-du-Rouvray. \nHollande said French people could be proud for continuing “to live, work, go out, move around and cherish ... freedom.” \nPolice were out in force — with over 10,000 deployed in the French capital alone — and authorities said that “the passage to the New Year will take place in the context of a persistent and very high terrorist threat.” \n——— \nTHE VATICAN \nPope Francis has called on the faithful to help young people find a place in society, noting the paradox of “a culture that idolizes youth” and yet has made no place for the young. \nFrancis said during vespers marking New Year’s Eve that young people have been “pushed to the margins of public life, forcing them to migrate or to beg for jobs that no longer exist, or fail to promise them a future.” \nMore than responsibility, the pope said the world owed young people a debt, saying it has deprived them of “dignified and genuine work” that would allow them to take part in society, instead condemning them “to knock on doors that for the most part remain closed.” \n——— \nJAPAN \nTemple bells echoed at midnight as families gather around noodles and revelers flock to shrines for the biggest holiday in Japan. \n“I feel this sense of duality,” said Kami Miyamoto, 21, an economics student at Meiji University in Tokyo, who travelled home in Hakusan, Ishikawa prefecture, for the holiday. \n“The world is heading toward conservative insular policies,” she said of the U.S. election, Brexit and what she believes lies ahead for elections in Europe in 2017. “We learned about how valuable it is to get correct information.” \nOne of the most memorable experiences for Miyamoto in 2016 was a three-week study program in South Korea. She was surprised and moved by the friendship she formed with South Korean students, and she has decided to focus her studies on relations with South Korea. \n“Studying about the U.S. and Europe seems to be about looking at the past, but East Asian studies are focusing on the future,” she said. \nMiyamoto’s mother is preparing soba noodles, a standard New Year’s Eve dish in Japan, except in their home it will be filled with green onions and shrimp. As the new year rolls in, the entire family, including her younger brother and sister, will drive to a nearby shrine, which, like temples all over Japan, will be filled with those praying for good fortune in the Year of the Rooster, according to the Chinese zodiac. \n——— \nCHINA \nResidents in Beijing and Shanghai, China’s two largest cities, were passing New Year’s Eve quietly in a relative state of security lockdown, according to Chinese media reports citing police. \nThe Bund waterfront in Shanghai had no celebrations, authorities announced this week, while the sale, use and transportation of fireworks in central Shanghai will be prohibited altogether. Large buildings that often display light shows also stayed dark. More than 30 people died two years ago in a deadly stampede on Shanghai’s waterfront, where 300,000 people had gathered to watch a planned light show. \nBeijing police also said countdowns, light shows, lotteries and other organized activities will not be held in popular shopping districts such as Sanlitun and Guomao. Beijing police advised citizens to avoid crowded areas, closely watch elderly relatives and children, and be aware of exit routes in venues. \nChinese President Xi Jinping said in his annual New Year’s Eve address that his government will continue to focus on alleviating poverty at home and resolutely defending China’s territorial rights. \n——— \nSOUTH KOREA \nHundreds of thousands of South Koreans ushered in the new year with a massive protest demanding the resignation of disgraced President Park Geun-hye. It was the 10th straight weekend of protests that led to Park’s impeachment on Dec. 9 over a corruption scandal. \nThe evening rally was planned to overlap with Seoul’s traditional bell-tolling ceremony at the Bosinkgak pavilion at midnight, which was also expected to be a political statement against Park. \nThe city’s mayor, Park Won-soon, invited as guests a man whose teenage son was among more than 300 people who died during a 2014 ferry sinking, and a woman who was forced into sexual slavery by Japan’s Second World War military. \nPark Geun-hye came under heavy criticism over the way her government handled the ferry disaster. \n“So many unbelievable things happened in 2016. It didn’t feel real; if felt like a movie,” protester Lee Huymi said about the bizarre scandal that brought Park down. “So I hope 2017 brings a movie-like ending to the mess.” \n——— \nINDIA \nFor most people in India, New Year’s Eve is a time for family. In New Delhi and many other cities, newspapers are full of big advertisements for lavish parties at upscale hotels and restaurants. The big draws at the hotel parties are song and dance performances from Bollywood and television stars. \nThe western city of Mumbai will host big street parties with thousands of people at the iconic Gateway of India, a colonial-era structure on the waterfront overlooking the Arabian Sea. And there was talk about money — India’s recent devaluing of its currency in an apparent effort to cut graft and tax evasion. \n“2016 was boring but Modi brought about a twister near the end,” 18-year-old student Jugal Jadhwani said of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s announcement in early November. \n“It’s good for India,” he said. \nIt was a sentiment echoed by 42-year old Prasoon Verma. \n“2016 was good and with demonetization 2017 should be good for the Indian economy and India should move to the digital age,” he said. \n——— \nPHILIPPINES \nThe Philippines’ notorious tradition of dangerous New Year’s Eve celebrations persisted after President Rodrigo Duterte delayed to next year his ban on the use of powerful firecrackers, often worsened by celebratory gunfire. \nPowerful firecrackers and gunfire have maimed hundreds of people and killed some each year across the Philippines despite government crackdowns, an annual government scare campaign and efforts by officials to set up centralized fireworks displays, like on Saturday night. \nDuterte’s southern Davao City hasn’t been tainted by the bloody record because of a largely successful firecrackers ban he enforced when he was still the city’s crime-busting mayor. Last month, he said he would delay his plan to replicate his Davao ban nationwide by a year because many have already invested in firecrackers and he was concerned by the impact of an abrupt ban on poor Filipinos employed in the industry. \nBefore New Year’s Eve, the Department of Health said Saturday that 139 people had been injured by firecracker blasts in recent days, mostly children under 15. \n——— \nROMANIA \nNew Year’s is the biggest party of the year in Romania, and thousands flocked to the mountains to ski, hike and celebrate, some in the mood for fun, others anxious about global challenges in 2017. \nFormer Finance Minister Daniel Daianu, travelling to the mountain town of Sinaia, told The Associated Press that Western governments should pay closer attention to the public mood. \n“People are frustrated, people are resentful and people react,” he said. “Unless governments pay attention to fairness and fair play, we could see some very unpleasant surprises.” \nEarly Saturday, young Romanians roamed streets and trains, wearing peasant costumes and singing traditional songs about goats — a New Year symbol — while waving wands made of dried flowers. \nOne tradition was squelched this year. Police banned masked revelers in the northeastern village of Ruginoasa from staging a traditional fight between young men involving whips and bats after several people were injured a few years ago. \n——— \nUNITED ARAB EMIRATES \nIn Dubai, hundreds of thousands of people watched fireworks shoot from the sides of the world’s tallest building, the 828-metre (2,716-foot) Burj Khalifa. The show was also streamed live online. \nThere was no repeat of last year’s excitement, when police say faulty wiring sparked a fire several hours before midnight at The Address Downtown, a 63-storey skyscraper nearby. The high-rise tower still remains under repair. \nJust before the fireworks, private security guards stood every 50 metres (55 yards) as metal barriers blocked off sidewalks to keep the streets around the Burj Khalifa clear for roaming emergency vehicles, their strobe lights flashing in the darkness. \nWhile 2016 brought challenges across the world, those gathered to watch the fireworks in Dubai instead chose to focus on the positive. \nFor Ina Dumdum, 33, of Manila, Philippines, 2016 brought a new job in Abu Dhabi and greater economic security. Wearing a pink pair of do-it-yourself “Happy New Year” rabbit ears on her head, she smiled while saying she hoped for a baby in the New Year. “2016 was prosperity,” she said. \nTony Ngalande, 38, of Lilongwe, Malawi, also saw success in his automobile importing business. However, “2016 was full of a lot of surprises,” he said, mentioning the election of Donald Trump in the U.S. and the British vote to leave the European Union. \nNgalande laughed when asked if those surprises could portend anything negative for the new year. “So far so good,” he said with a smile.

      "title": "Revelers bid adieu to 2016 | The London Free Press",
      "text": "\nAs 2016 draws to a close, revelers around the world are bidding a weary adieu to a year filled with political surprises, prolonged conflicts and deaths of legendary celebrities. \nHow people are ushering in the new year: \nAUSTRALIA \nSydney sent up a dazzling tribute to 2016’s fallen icons with a New Year’s Eve fireworks display honouring the late singer David Bowie and late actor Gene Wilder, becoming the first major city to bid a bittersweet adieu to a turbulent year. \nThe glittering display over Sydney’s famed harbour and bridge featured Saturn and star-shaped fireworks set to “Space Oddity,” the classic song by Bowie — one of the seemingly endless parade of beloved entertainers who died in 2016. \nWilder was also honoured as the bridge lit up in a rainbow of colours while a song from Wilder’s famed film “Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory” played. \n“This year, sadly, we saw the loss of many music and entertainment legends around the world,” fireworks show co-producer Catherine Flanagan said. “So celebrating their music as part of Sydney New Year’s Eve fireworks displays is an opportunity to reflect on the year that has been and what the future may hold.” \n——— \nLAS VEGAS \nMore than 300,000 visitors are expected to descend on Las Vegas for an extravagant New Year’s Eve celebration. \nNightclubs are pulling out all the stops with performances from DJ Calvin Harris, rappers T-Pain and Kendrick Lamar and artists Drake and Bruno Mars. The city’s celebrity chefs have crafted elaborate prix fixe menus complete with caviar and champagne toasts. \nAn eight-minute fireworks show will kick off at the stroke of midnight, with rockets launching from the tops of half a dozen casinos. \nFederal officials have ranked the celebration just below the Super Bowl and on par with the festivities in Times Square. FBI and Secret Service agents will work alongside local police departments that are putting all hands on deck for the big night. \n——— \nGERMANY \nIn Berlin the mood was more sombre than celebratory. \n“I don’t like the way politics is going,” said Daniel Brandt. “Fears are being fanned and people are so angry with each other.” \nThe tone of public debate in Germany has become shriller over the past two years with the influx of hundreds of thousands of migrants. \nTwo Israeli tourists, on a visit to the German capital, seemed at a loss when asked about their wishes for 2017. “Peace on Earth. Just happiness, really,” said Nathan and Libat, declining to give their last names. \nWalking by the Reichstag, Germany’s Parliament building, Hamed Noori said 2016 had been a good year. “I came to Germany from Afghanistan,” he said. “Life is better here.” \nBirgitta Bergquist, a recent retiree visiting Berlin from Sweden, said she looked forward to spending more time with her three-year-old granddaughter. “And we hope the family stays healthy.” \nNicole Durand-Nusser, originally from France but living in Berlin for almost 50 years, said 2016 had been a difficult year: “Brexit, Trump, Erdogan — it’s all getting worse. \n“I’m a convinced European and I hope Europe doesn’t collapse in 2017,” she said. \nLater, police said they arrested a man who shouted “bomb, bomb, bomb” at Berlin’s massive open-air New Year’s party. \nUsing the hashtag “#nichtlustig”— meaning “not funny”— Berlin police tweeted Saturday that the unnamed man “is now celebrating #Welcome2017 with us.” \n——— \nTURKEY \nNeslihan Dogruol, a restaurant owner in a chic Istanbul neighbourhood, said she hopes for peace in 2017 following a year filled with “unrest and death.” \n“2016 affected everyone badly,” she said, referring to major attacks that hit Turkey in the past year. \nThe restaurant, adorned with snowflakes and tiny decorative lights for the evening, will have fewer people for dinner. “There is a serious gap between 2015 and 2016 in terms of business, people are going out less,” Dogruol said, adding that she expects more people to come for drinks. \nAt a commemoration for the 45 people killed in twin bombings on Dec. 10 in Istanbul, 38-year-old Murat Manoglu hoped for a better year ahead. “We lived through terrible days, we have lost many martyrs, many households suffered,” he said. \nSecurity measures were heightened in major Turkish cities. Traffic leading up to key squares in Istanbul and the capital, Ankara, will be closed, police said. In Istanbul, 17,000 police officers were on duty, some camouflaged as Santa Claus and others as street vendors, Turkey’s state-run Anadolu news agency reported on Friday. \nAnkara and Istanbul were targeted by bomb attacks in 2016, killing more than 180 people. Turkey has been in the throes of violence, combating the Islamic State group, Kurdish militants and a coup attempt blamed on the U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen. \n——— \nRUSSIA \nPresident Vladimir Putin invoked a bit of seasonal enchantment in his New Year’s Eve remarks to the nation. \n“Each of us may become something of a magician on the night of the New Year,” Putin said in a short televised address broadcast in the closing minutes of 2016 in each of Russia’s 11 time zones. \n“To do this we simply need to treat our parents with love and gratitude, take care of our children and families, respect our colleagues at work, nurture our friendships, defend truth and justice, be merciful and help those who are in need of support. This is the whole secret,” he said. \nNew Year’s Eve is Russia’s major gift-giving holiday, and big Russian cities were awash in festive lights and decorations. The Moscow subway offered a special holiday train, festooned with lights and artificial greenery. \n“I wish for the next year to better than this,” said rider Alexander Pisaryev. \n“We are waiting for good, for peace and order,” said another, Valentina Daineka. \n——— \nPARIS \nTourists and French revelers swarmed along Paris’ illuminated Champs Elysees Avenue on a frosty night, admiring the laser display from the Arc de Triomphe and lines of trees sparkling with lights. \n“It’s so magical to be here in Paris, on what people say is the world’s most beautiful avenue,” said Maureen O’Reilly, 42, a visitor from Belfast, Northern Ireland. \n“At times like this, I do think about all those terrible things in Aleppo and how lucky we are here in Europe despite everything,” she added. \nSome were happy to say goodbye to 2016. \n“It’s been such a horrible year, with all these (entertainment celebrity) deaths, Syria, Brexit and Trump. I say: good riddance,” said Karine Dublot, 38, from Lyon. \nOthers found a bright side. \n“My hope for 2017 is that we solve all the problems with the migrants here in France, and see the end of (President) Francois Hollande,” said Marc Valli, 35, from Paris. “We need someone who can sort out immigration as president.” \nHollande, who is not standing for re-election in the upcoming ballot, used his last New Year’s address to praise his country’s resilience in the face of deadly attacks in Nice and Saint-Etienne-du-Rouvray. \nHollande said French people could be proud for continuing “to live, work, go out, move around and cherish ... freedom.” \nPolice were out in force — with over 10,000 deployed in the French capital alone — and authorities said that “the passage to the New Year will take place in the context of a persistent and very high terrorist threat.” \n——— \nTHE VATICAN \nPope Francis has called on the faithful to help young people find a place in society, noting the paradox of “a culture that idolizes youth” and yet has made no place for the young. \nFrancis said during vespers marking New Year’s Eve that young people have been “pushed to the margins of public life, forcing them to migrate or to beg for jobs that no longer exist, or fail to promise them a future.” \nMore than responsibility, the pope said the world owed young people a debt, saying it has deprived them of “dignified and genuine work” that would allow them to take part in society, instead condemning them “to knock on doors that for the most part remain closed.” \n——— \nJAPAN \nTemple bells echoed at midnight as families gather around noodles and revelers flock to shrines for the biggest holiday in Japan. \n“I feel this sense of duality,” said Kami Miyamoto, 21, an economics student at Meiji University in Tokyo, who travelled home in Hakusan, Ishikawa prefecture, for the holiday. \n“The world is heading toward conservative insular policies,” she said of the U.S. election, Brexit and what she believes lies ahead for elections in Europe in 2017. “We learned about how valuable it is to get correct information.” \nOne of the most memorable experiences for Miyamoto in 2016 was a three-week study program in South Korea. She was surprised and moved by the friendship she formed with South Korean students, and she has decided to focus her studies on relations with South Korea. \n“Studying about the U.S. and Europe seems to be about looking at the past, but East Asian studies are focusing on the future,” she said. \nMiyamoto’s mother is preparing soba noodles, a standard New Year’s Eve dish in Japan, except in their home it will be filled with green onions and shrimp. As the new year rolls in, the entire family, including her younger brother and sister, will drive to a nearby shrine, which, like temples all over Japan, will be filled with those praying for good fortune in the Year of the Rooster, according to the Chinese zodiac. \n——— \nCHINA \nResidents in Beijing and Shanghai, China’s two largest cities, were passing New Year’s Eve quietly in a relative state of security lockdown, according to Chinese media reports citing police. \nThe Bund waterfront in Shanghai had no celebrations, authorities announced this week, while the sale, use and transportation of fireworks in central Shanghai will be prohibited altogether. Large buildings that often display light shows also stayed dark. More than 30 people died two years ago in a deadly stampede on Shanghai’s waterfront, where 300,000 people had gathered to watch a planned light show. \nBeijing police also said countdowns, light shows, lotteries and other organized activities will not be held in popular shopping districts such as Sanlitun and Guomao. Beijing police advised citizens to avoid crowded areas, closely watch elderly relatives and children, and be aware of exit routes in venues. \nChinese President Xi Jinping said in his annual New Year’s Eve address that his government will continue to focus on alleviating poverty at home and resolutely defending China’s territorial rights. \n——— \nSOUTH KOREA \nHundreds of thousands of South Koreans ushered in the new year with a massive protest demanding the resignation of disgraced President Park Geun-hye. It was the 10th straight weekend of protests that led to Park’s impeachment on Dec. 9 over a corruption scandal. \nThe evening rally was planned to overlap with Seoul’s traditional bell-tolling ceremony at the Bosinkgak pavilion at midnight, which was also expected to be a political statement against Park. \nThe city’s mayor, Park Won-soon, invited as guests a man whose teenage son was among more than 300 people who died during a 2014 ferry sinking, and a woman who was forced into sexual slavery by Japan’s Second World War military. \nPark Geun-hye came under heavy criticism over the way her government handled the ferry disaster. \n“So many unbelievable things happened in 2016. It didn’t feel real; if felt like a movie,” protester Lee Huymi said about the bizarre scandal that brought Park down. “So I hope 2017 brings a movie-like ending to the mess.” \n——— \nINDIA \nFor most people in India, New Year’s Eve is a time for family. In New Delhi and many other cities, newspapers are full of big advertisements for lavish parties at upscale hotels and restaurants. The big draws at the hotel parties are song and dance performances from Bollywood and television stars. \nThe western city of Mumbai will host big street parties with thousands of people at the iconic Gateway of India, a colonial-era structure on the waterfront overlooking the Arabian Sea. And there was talk about money — India’s recent devaluing of its currency in an apparent effort to cut graft and tax evasion. \n“2016 was boring but Modi brought about a twister near the end,” 18-year-old student Jugal Jadhwani said of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s announcement in early November. \n“It’s good for India,” he said. \nIt was a sentiment echoed by 42-year old Prasoon Verma. \n“2016 was good and with demonetization 2017 should be good for the Indian economy and India should move to the digital age,” he said. \n——— \nPHILIPPINES \nThe Philippines’ notorious tradition of dangerous New Year’s Eve celebrations persisted after President Rodrigo Duterte delayed to next year his ban on the use of powerful firecrackers, often worsened by celebratory gunfire. \nPowerful firecrackers and gunfire have maimed hundreds of people and killed some each year across the Philippines despite government crackdowns, an annual government scare campaign and efforts by officials to set up centralized fireworks displays, like on Saturday night. \nDuterte’s southern Davao City hasn’t been tainted by the bloody record because of a largely successful firecrackers ban he enforced when he was still the city’s crime-busting mayor. Last month, he said he would delay his plan to replicate his Davao ban nationwide by a year because many have already invested in firecrackers and he was concerned by the impact of an abrupt ban on poor Filipinos employed in the industry. \nBefore New Year’s Eve, the Department of Health said Saturday that 139 people had been injured by firecracker blasts in recent days, mostly children under 15. \n——— \nROMANIA \nNew Year’s is the biggest party of the year in Romania, and thousands flocked to the mountains to ski, hike and celebrate, some in the mood for fun, others anxious about global challenges in 2017. \nFormer Finance Minister Daniel Daianu, travelling to the mountain town of Sinaia, told The Associated Press that Western governments should pay closer attention to the public mood. \n“People are frustrated, people are resentful and people react,” he said. “Unless governments pay attention to fairness and fair play, we could see some very unpleasant surprises.” \nEarly Saturday, young Romanians roamed streets and trains, wearing peasant costumes and singing traditional songs about goats — a New Year symbol — while waving wands made of dried flowers. \nOne tradition was squelched this year. Police banned masked revelers in the northeastern village of Ruginoasa from staging a traditional fight between young men involving whips and bats after several people were injured a few years ago. \n——— \nUNITED ARAB EMIRATES \nIn Dubai, hundreds of thousands of people watched fireworks shoot from the sides of the world’s tallest building, the 828-metre (2,716-foot) Burj Khalifa. The show was also streamed live online. \nThere was no repeat of last year’s excitement, when police say faulty wiring sparked a fire several hours before midnight at The Address Downtown, a 63-storey skyscraper nearby. The high-rise tower still remains under repair. \nJust before the fireworks, private security guards stood every 50 metres (55 yards) as metal barriers blocked off sidewalks to keep the streets around the Burj Khalifa clear for roaming emergency vehicles, their strobe lights flashing in the darkness. \nWhile 2016 brought challenges across the world, those gathered to watch the fireworks in Dubai instead chose to focus on the positive. \nFor Ina Dumdum, 33, of Manila, Philippines, 2016 brought a new job in Abu Dhabi and greater economic security. Wearing a pink pair of do-it-yourself “Happy New Year” rabbit ears on her head, she smiled while saying she hoped for a baby in the New Year. “2016 was prosperity,” she said. \nTony Ngalande, 38, of Lilongwe, Malawi, also saw success in his automobile importing business. However, “2016 was full of a lot of surprises,” he said, mentioning the election of Donald Trump in the U.S. and the British vote to leave the European Union. \nNgalande laughed when asked if those surprises could portend anything negative for the new year. “So far so good,” he said with a smile.

At least (former Prime Minister) Manmohan Singh had the respect of the world.\"\"Demonetisation is the biggest scandal in independent India,\" Kejriwal said. \"The entire exercise was political and guided by corruption.\" He claimed that even hardcore BJP and RSS supporters were disappointed by Modi's speech of Saturday because he failed to mention when people could resume withdrawing money from their bank accounts at will.\"There should be an independent investigation into the note ban,\" he said. \"There should also be a White Paper on the stated objectives of the demonetisation and what was really achieved.\" He said the White Paper should detail the fall in GDP growth and in industrial and agricultural production after the November 8 announcement. Kejriwal and the AAP have been among the most vocal critics of the note ban which caused an unprecedented cash crunch in the country. He said after all the hardships that people endured, none of the stated objectives in Modi's November 8 speech were achieved. He said there had been no reduction in corruption, black money had not been wiped out and terror financing had not ended. The AAP leader accused the BJP leaders of converting black money into white before and amid the cash shortage and demanded to know why Modi was promoting Paytm for cashless transactions. \"Has he taken bribes from Paytm? Paytm is the biggest gainer from demonetisation.\" Kejriwal also denounced Delhi Metro's fiat that only Paytm transactions would be considered valid in select metro stations.\"They can't do this. They can't promote one single company. I will ask them... Maybe they are under pressure.\" loading...",

At least (former Prime Minister) Manmohan Singh had the respect of the world.\"\"Demonetisation is the biggest scandal in independent India,\" Kejriwal said. \"The entire exercise was political and guided by corruption.\" He claimed that even hardcore BJP and RSS supporters were disappointed by Modi's speech of Saturday because he failed to mention when people could resume withdrawing money from their bank accounts at will.\"There should be an independent investigation into the note ban,\" he said. \"There should also be a White Paper on the stated objectives of the demonetisation and what was really achieved.\" He said the White Paper should detail the fall in GDP growth and in industrial and agricultural production after the November 8 announcement. Kejriwal and the AAP have been among the most vocal critics of the note ban which caused an unprecedented cash crunch in the country. He said after all the hardships that people endured, none of the stated objectives in Modi's November 8 speech were achieved. He said there had been no reduction in corruption, black money had not been wiped out and terror financing had not ended. The AAP leader accused the BJP leaders of converting black money into white before and amid the cash shortage and demanded to know why Modi was promoting Paytm for cashless transactions.\"Has he taken bribes from Paytm? Paytm is the biggest gainer from demonetisation.\" Kejriwal also denounced Delhi Metro's fiat that only Paytm transactions would be considered valid in select metro stations.\"They can't do this. They can't promote one single company. I will ask them... Maybe they are under pressure.\"",

      "text": "Expecting to buy or sell a home in Toronto in 2017? Here's what to expect Realtors are looking for the crazy competition to continue in Toronto's real estate. Share on Facebook Staff / Torstar news service Order this photo A Toronto house that's listed for sale. Photo taken December 22, 2016. By: Staff Torstar News Service Published on Is 2017 the year that the sizzle starts to sputter on the Toronto region's overheated real estate market? That's possible, says John Pasalis, of data-digging brokerage Realosophy near Queen and Leslie Sts. \"As the craziness continues, I suspect that might trigger some bigger changes,\" he said in reference to government measures already implemented this year such as more rigorous stress testing of lending qualifications. \"I suspect that Ottawa or the province are only going to be fine with 30 per cent year-over-year appreciation (in housing prices) for so long before they do something else that's drastic,\" he said. Here's what other industry experts are predicting: Interest rates The inching up of interest rates and more stringent mortgage rules are among the factors that could play a role in tempering sales in the hot Toronto region market, says Jason Mercer, director of market analysis for the Toronto Real Estate Board (TREB). Those influences could be enough for some households to put a home purchase on hold. But Mercer says most consumers will look for other choices in order to pursue their home ownership dreams. \"If you were thinking of buying a single detached home in Toronto, maybe now you're looking at purchasing in one of the surrounding regions or you're going to change both your home type and the geography you're looking for,\" he said. The Trump effect Bond yields have already risen, leading to those marginally higher mortgage rates. But whether the inauguration of Donald Trump will ripple into the housing market is all part and parcel of the global economy, said Mercer. \"Obviously any factor that could affect the economy from a positive or negative perspective has to be taken into account,\" he said. Tim Hudak, CEO of the Ontario Real Estate Association (OREA), which represents 40 real estate boards across the province, is optimistic. \"There certainly seems to be a view that the American economy will grow faster now,\" he said. But that puts pressure on U.S. interest rates, which will force a decision around our own interest rates or letting our currency drop. \"Particularly in the GTA, real estate is a great investment. As the expression goes, we're not making any more of it,\" said Hudak. Supply and demand Industry sources agree that the lack of listings — resale and new homes —will continue to be the real estate story next year. Mercer predicts that re-sale listings will continue to materialize at very low levels, driving up prices. April Williams, broker of record at Royal Lepage Terrequity Realty, expects listings will be scarcer in 2017 than they were this year. \"I don't see a lot of people making lateral moves. With the closing costs and the cost of homes it doesn't make sense,” said Williams. “I think we're going to see a lot more people that are either up-sizing or down-sizing, which is going to keep the amount of listings low next year — which could create higher prices and more bidding wars.\" The supply of new homes will also continue its decline, says Bryan Tuckey of the Building Industry and Land Development Association (BILD). There were 2,300 low-rise homes on the market in October compared to 4,000 in January, he said. A lack of serviced designated lands means \"our members are still struggling to get homes on the market,\" he said. Condos High housing prices are bringing condo lifestyles into the mainstream for more young families, says Matthew Slutsky of online development hub BuzzBuzzHome. He expects to see more activity on the condo market with 29 launches and 131 scheduled completions expected in 2017. The range of choice in the condo sector continues to grow, said Slutsky. He cites mega-developments like Rogers' M City in Mississauga — 6,000 units in 10 towers — and smaller, niche buildings such as the Museum Flts in Toronto's Junction Triangle. Wise investors are also looking at older condos because they frequently offer more space. \"One of the beautiful things about a condo is that all the amenities can act as your living place,\" he said, adding that gyms and pools are features that have longstanding appeal to every type of buyer. There's a declining interest in gimmicks like bowling alleys. New condos are also getting larger, says Tuckey. But that will also affect price. Condo prices have gone up 10 per cent year over year. \"Over the years, some of the increased cost in land, construction and time were masked a little bit because sizes were getting smaller,\" he said. Williams, who works out of Liberty Village, says she's already seeing a demand for those larger units. As well, she said, more clients are looking for outdoor space and a view. Proximity to the subway is also increasingly important as parking and congestion become more expensive and time-consuming, she said. Two or three years ago the record number of condos under construction and the completions coming down the pipe might have raised concerns about inventory, said Mercer. But if there were fewer units on the market, the Toronto region might have pushed the high-rise segment to be as tight as the market for detached, semis and townhomes, he said. Price growth in the condo field also \"speaks to the strong first-time buyer activity we continue to see in the city of Toronto and the surrounding region,\" he said. Competition for homes New lending rules this fall have slowed things down, said Royal LePage agent Desmond Brown, but competition is still alive and well among buyers vying for the same property. The difference, he said, is that instead of 10 offers, the seller might be looking at six or eight. But as 2016 draws to a close, Brown said he's seeing more conditional offers being accepted and some properties are sitting on the market a bit longer. \"In the million-dollar range and under it's still pretty busy,\" he said. But he added, \"We're not really sure what's going to happen in January and February, which has been really busy over the last five years. People just might be exhausted.\" First-time buyers With the new mortgage stress tests introduced by Ottawa in October, Brown says he's already seeing fewer of the first-time buyers that fuel the market. \"We've had a couple of deals fall apart because the buyers thought they were qualified for a certain amount of money and then the new mortgage rule came in and we were in the middle of an offer and they found out they didn't qualify for as much as they thought they had,\" he said. If somebody qualified for $650,000 they're only qualifying for $500,000 under the new rules, said Brown. \"I have a lot of potential buyers who would love to get in the market and we're hoping things will stay the same as they are right now where it gives them a chance to go in and negotiate,\" he said. But among first-time buyers, Brown says there's a growing understanding that they have to be realistic. Some are looking at income properties that help them carry the mortgage. They're understanding, he said, that a starter home isn't necessarily going to be your dream home. In some cases that means looking outside their preferred neighbourhoods, said Williams. Even with the help of government measures such as the doubling of the provincial land transfer tax rebate for first-time buyers, it's a tough entry-level market, she said. \"I feel like the odds are stacked against you,” said Williams. “You are seeing more and more parents help their kids but not everyone has that ability.\" In new home sales, Tuckey said, \"Town homes have become the new single. \"They're the living style that people are pleased to be in when they have families and want to try and be a little closer to the ground,\" he said. He predicts that builders will continue to innovate with more stacked, back-to-back and smaller townhomes to make them affordable. Policy Those townhomes will house more people in the region particularly as Queen's Park moves ahead to update its growth plan to create a denser region. Home buyers and the industry have to start to focus on the housing supply that will necessarily be part of that density. While the effects of the first iteration of the growth plan have yet to be felt, home builders are counselling the government to take a measured approach in newer denser intensity targets. \"This is our new normal and I'm not sure people in Toronto understand that,\" said Tuckey. \"The province wants intensification to be part of the future and that does put pressure on existing communities,\" he said. OREA's Hudak says the provincial land policies that are feeding denser development are for \"well-intentioned environmental reasons.\" But, he said, the pendulum has swung too far. \"You've really restricted land use in the GTA until you have more people who are chasing fewer houses and that's forcing price increases,\" he said. \"It's certainly very clear from our data that we need to get more housing options out there for people, particularly for first-time home buyers, added Hudak. “There's a lot of people who are interested in moving into the GTA from Ontario or internationally,” he said. “That's a sign of economic success and potential. We're just not building enough homes for them.” Two other policy changes on the horizon: a development charge review could add another cost for homeowners and inclusionary zoning requiring developers to set aside some new units for lower income households — if done improperly — could make all housing more expensive, said Tuckey.

      "text": "Twitterati's mixed reaction to Modi's New Year eve address IANS (File photo) \n\nSocial media offered mixed reactions to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's much awaited address to the nation on the eve of New Year with some hailing the sops announced by him while most of them criticised him for not announcing a way out of the cash crunch. \nAs Modi, during his post demonetisation address, announced a slew of sops for the poor, farmers and small traders, the groups perceived to be worst hit by the November 8 demonetisation that caused widespread economic upheaval in the country, people took to social networking sites to express their views.\"Pregnant women will get 6,000 bucks for childbirth. That's what you call 'Cash on delivery #ModiSpeech #Mitron,\" Aksh Arijitian tweeted referring to Modi's scheme aimed at countering maternity mortality rate. \"Modi's speech was so useless that all eminent intellectuals spent their new years eve watching his speech, instead of partying, to find flaws,\" tweeted @WoCharLo. A Twitter user with his the name @VoiceOfPM criticised the PM's speech.\"Modi Ji, common man will NOT SPARE you in 2019, BUT giving a CHANCE in coming 2 years to come out clean.. #SaharaDiaries #ModiSpeech,\" he said.\"50 days Sacrifice ends in discounts on various loans.Sir @PMOIndia we expected lot ,Maybe this much you had for #India in 2016 #ModiSpeech,\" said Bodhisattwa Guha. It was not just a speech it was an assurance to Poors farmers old n honest people that this govt is firmly stand with them #ModiSpeech,\" said another Twitter user. Many users hailed Modi's address.\"#ModiSpeech today my respect toward my PM becomes double,\" tweeted one.\"The meltdown of the Lutyens liberals continues unhindered; 50 days are getting longer for them,\" said another.\"People who planned to take shots whenever Modi says Mitron, gonna sleep sober tonight. ?? #ModiSpeech\" But there were some who were sarcastic of Modi's speech.\"Modi is addressing the way engineers write answers. Come to the point Sir,\" read a tweet.\"Didn't use \"Mitron\" even once? MODI HAS UNFRIENDED THE NATION,\" said another referring to Mitron (friends) used often by Modi during his speeches. Another Twitter user Navin Khaitan asked \"How much old currency is back? How much new currency released? Who advised Govt on decisions? PM has NO Answers\"!\"Modi just trolled 125 crore Indians on NewYearsEve,\" said another user.",

      "text": "SBI cuts cost of lending rate by 0.9% across maturities IANS (File photo) \n\nWith major infusion of fresh liquidity arising from the demonetisation measure, state-run State Bank of India said on Sunday it had cut its lending rates by 90 basis points for maturities ranging from overnight to three-year tenures, after experiencing a surge in deposits. \nThe country's largest lender cut its marginal cost of funds-based lending rates (MCLR) effective from New Year's Day in response to a surge in deposits post the demonetisation of high value currency on November 8. For loans of overnight tenure, the new MCLR will be 7.75 per cent, instead of 8.65 per cent. One-month tenure will attract a rate of 7.85 per cent, while those for three and six months will be 7.90 and 7.95 per cent, respectively. For one year, the new MCLR will be 8 per cent. The bank will levy interest rate of 8.10 per cent and 8.15 per cent for two years and three years, respectively. Lending rates were lowered also across other maturities, effective from Sunday. According to estimates, banks have collected cash deposits of over Rs 14.9 lakh crore following Prime Minister Narendra Modi's November 8 announcement, demonetising Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 notes to eliminate black money, counterfeit notes and terror financing. The SBI move also comes after Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his address to the nation on Saturday asked banks to \"keep the poor, the lower middle class, and the middle class at the focus of their activities,\" and to act with \"public interest\" in mind. State-owned IDBI Bank has also cut in its MCLR by 30-60 basis points (bps) effective Sunday. The bank said it has effectively reduced MCLR by 30 bps to 60 bps across various tenures since April 2016. Under the MCLR, banks need to consider their marginal cost of funds, or the cost incurred on incremental deposits across different maturities, to decide on interest rates. Private sector Axis Bank cut its MCLR in November by 0.15-0.20 per cent Following the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) cutting its repo rate by 25 bps last month, public sector lenders -- the United Bank of India, Canara Bank, Indian Bank, Indian Overseas Bank, Bank of India and the Syndicate Bank -- as well as the private sector ICICI and Kotak Mahindra banks have cut lending rates. To nudge banks to transfer the benefit of RBI rate cuts, previous Governor Raghuram Rajan had announced a shift to the MCLR regime, under which banks need to consider their marginal cost of funds, or the cost incurred on incremental deposits across different maturities, to decide on interest rates. However, though Rajan -- during his tenure -- had cut rates by 150 bps since January 2015, banks had hardly moved at the same pace to cut their lending rates. From the state-run banks' point of view, their accumulation of massive non-performing assets (NPAs), or bad loans, that is impacting profitability, is keeping them from cutting rates. loading...",

      "text": "By Kyle Rearden \n“Agorism upholds the free market…the term ‘agorism’ is derived from the ancient Greek word meaning an open market place. The market is not a single place or center. Goods and services are exchanged at the corner store, on the stock exchange, at a swap meet, in your backyard, or across the Internet…in reality, a completely free market is a highly decentralized order.” \n– Sam Konkin \nCryptoagorism is the merger of crypto-anarchy and agorism; the former is a libertarian strategy of using digital technology (including encryption protocols) to frustrate the State’s capabilities of surveillance, and the latter is another libertarian strategy of using counter-economic (black and grey market) trade in order to abolish the State itself. Whether they be starving or smashing the State, cryptoagorists use direct action in order to bring statism to an end. \nBuilding a “ second realm ” through crypto-anarchy is a pivotal theme in this novella. Daniel LaRusso, the protagonist, summarizes the concept thusly: \n“They call the current society the ‘First Realm.’ The First Realm is ruled by politicians, personal freedoms are inhibited and restrained. Rather than advocating a revolution, they want to build a ‘Second Realm,’ one that is free from the rulers of the First Realm. More and more parts of our lives can be transferred to the Second Realm, until an individual lives mostly free in the Second Realm, while being technically ruled over in the First Realm…technically, the Second Realm is described as encrypted communication, encrypted currencies, anonymous and pseudonymous identities and untraceable action…I could be my usual self in the First Realm, pay some taxes, pretend to have a normal job and be an ordinary citizen. In the Second Realm, I could be free.” \nSecond Realm-ers use tools like crypto-currencies , email encryption , dark smartphones , and cryptomarkets as privacy-enhancing technologies . There is a scene where one of the cryptoagorists, Denton, teaches Daniel about how to use smartphone apps to pay for goods (hence a recurring motif of “ There’s an app for that! ”). Another scene is where a different cryptoagorist, Michael, explains to Daniel how he could make his livelihood selling laptops modded with privacy-enhancing free software : \n“See, you gotta have a password right in the beginning. There’s nothing at all you can do with this thing, not even enter the BIOS, without entering a password. The hard drive is encrypted, too. So if someone steals your laptop and plugs the drive into another computer, he won’t see shit…the cheapest mod we do is a $300 markup from the hardware. So if you order a $1,000 laptop, it’s $1,300…I think if they want a secure machine, Windows is not an option. And this isn’t really too different for the user. There’s LibreOffice, Firefox, and a few accounting apps…there’s Thunderbird with GPG preinstalled, of course. OpenVPN preconfigured. If you buy the premium package, it includes a one-year membership of encrypted Skynet VPN service. So you got your multi-hop VPN tunnel right there.” \nOnce Michael tells Daniel that he will be paid 10% commission on each sale of these free software modded laptops, Daniel eagerly sells them to whomever he can. Interestingly enough, there’s a traffic stop and interrogation room scene where Daniel is suspected by the police of trafficking in “stolen merchandise” because he’s got 27 laptops in his rental car (plus tens of thousands in paper Euros); thanks to Second Realm Insurance bought by Michael, a lawyer was quickly called to spring Daniel from the police station where he was being held under investigative detention. \nMy favorite character is Marie Dähnhardt. Known by her pseudonym, “Caty,” she’s the most developed, by far. Her explanation of why Michael’s laptop modding business is valuable is as follows: \n“Not everyone is so tech-savvy and not everyone wants to do that. You don’t clean your own clothes and grow your own foods. You could probably do it, but you got better things to do. Through economies of scale and specialization, some people just make more money doing other stuff for an hour than installing Linux and downloading software.” \nOf course, economies of scale reduce opportunity costs through the division of labor , as any economist worth his salt knows. What makes Caty intriguing is that despite her devil may care attitude , she is adroit, insightful, and rather quite charming (at least to me; most of the other male characters typically describe her as a bitch, but unlike those chumps, I truly enjoy her sarcastic persona). One of these enlightening attributes of hers is when Caty applies the Austrian subjective theory of value to dating : \n“This is a market process, Daniel. We’re both individuals looking at the market to meet our needs. Your need is to fuck a girl you think is hot. My need is to get fucked by a guy I think is hot. I’d say we can agree that there is a baseline we can work with. You’re obviously hot for me and I like you too. What needs to happen now is that we find a deal we both agree on. If we don’t, we have to satisfy our needs elsewhere or leave them unsatisfied.” \nCaty’s explanation here is brilliant, plain and simple. No overcomplicated psycho-analytical bullshit required here, at all. Better still, are Caty’s reasons why she won’t ever marry Daniel: \n“Listen to me, Daniel LaRusso. I will NEVER marry you. I repeat: never…because I love you…marriage is effectively a legal monopoly on another person’s love…if we get married, we won’t have as big an incentive to fulfill each other’s desires and needs. Because we don’t have to. The other person can’t just leave or take a better offer…incentives work, no matter how hard you try to ignore them. I would get fat and puffy and I’d stop shaving my pussy. You’d fart in bed and not shave and leave your dirty socks on the floor. Besides, what would I do with my legal monopoly on your cock? Sue you every time you’re hot for a blonde with a rack? How’s that going to stop your attraction to blondes?” \nThis is, quite literally, the most eloquent description of free love I’ve ever heard. Properly understood, the origins of free love weren’t based off of the so-called “ sexual revolution ” of the “ countercultural 1960s ,” but rather, a firm principled stand that, much like homeschooling (the separation of school and state) and private roads (the separation of travel from state), free love advocated for the separation of romance from the State . \nSpeaking of romance, no mention of it would be complete without family. The most heart-wrenching scene is after Daniel and Caty’s ordeal with the police when Denton takes them both to his home to crash for the night. Daniel is left alone with Denton’s wife, Lorelei, for a bit, and during their conversation, Daniel asks her about the scar along her abdomen. Lorelei answers: \n“The police…they broke down the door in the middle of the night. They were wearing full SWAT gear and automatic weapons. They threw a smoke grenade in the bedroom. I woke up coughing from Denton shouting for me to get under the bed…I didn’t make it. I screamed as one of them hit Denton in the head with the butt of his MP5. He went down and they kicked him. I tried to get to him and they threw me down, too. And kicked me. I was three months pregnant with my second child at the time…One of Denton’s clients was under suspicion of laundering money, at least that’s their justification for killing my unborn child. When I got back from the hospital, I said: You can’t stop now, Denton.” \nThis is further amplified when Lorelei’s young daughter asks her from the kitchen doorway if she was crying because she was telling what happened to her little baby brother. She then offers Lorelei her cushion because she thought her mom sounded sad, and therefore (as is typical of little kid logic), if she gave her cushion to her, her mom wouldn’t be sad anymore. Needless to say, the sharp contrast between Lorelei’s daughter and the SWAT thugs who murdered her sibling is meant to tug at your heartstrings, but it also explains why Denton refused to sleep with Caty earlier; he’s a family man bent on revenge. \nw4r2342 ‘s #agora is a wonderful novella full of insightful nuance. In many ways, it’s a more realistic portrayal of agorism than Alongside Night largely due to the insistence on practicing good security culture , although the beginnings of what could become something like the Revolutionary Agorist Cadre is implied in the ending. Fascinatingly, there’s numerous references to other literature I’ve never even heard of (both fictional and “instructive”), so perhaps this novella serves as a gateway portal to earlier works, which I might just have to check out and report back on \nThe post #agora appeared first on The Last Bastille Blog .

      "title": "Revelers bid adieu to 2016 | Northumberland Today",
      "text": "\nAs 2016 draws to a close, revelers around the world are bidding a weary adieu to a year filled with political surprises, prolonged conflicts and deaths of legendary celebrities. \nHow people are ushering in the new year: \nAUSTRALIA \nSydney sent up a dazzling tribute to 2016’s fallen icons with a New Year’s Eve fireworks display honouring the late singer David Bowie and late actor Gene Wilder, becoming the first major city to bid a bittersweet adieu to a turbulent year. \nThe glittering display over Sydney’s famed harbour and bridge featured Saturn and star-shaped fireworks set to “Space Oddity,” the classic song by Bowie — one of the seemingly endless parade of beloved entertainers who died in 2016. \nWilder was also honoured as the bridge lit up in a rainbow of colours while a song from Wilder’s famed film “Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory” played. \n“This year, sadly, we saw the loss of many music and entertainment legends around the world,” fireworks show co-producer Catherine Flanagan said. “So celebrating their music as part of Sydney New Year’s Eve fireworks displays is an opportunity to reflect on the year that has been and what the future may hold.” \n——— \nLAS VEGAS \nMore than 300,000 visitors are expected to descend on Las Vegas for an extravagant New Year’s Eve celebration. \nNightclubs are pulling out all the stops with performances from DJ Calvin Harris, rappers T-Pain and Kendrick Lamar and artists Drake and Bruno Mars. The city’s celebrity chefs have crafted elaborate prix fixe menus complete with caviar and champagne toasts. \nAn eight-minute fireworks show will kick off at the stroke of midnight, with rockets launching from the tops of half a dozen casinos. \nFederal officials have ranked the celebration just below the Super Bowl and on par with the festivities in Times Square. FBI and Secret Service agents will work alongside local police departments that are putting all hands on deck for the big night. \n——— \nGERMANY \nIn Berlin the mood was more sombre than celebratory. \n“I don’t like the way politics is going,” said Daniel Brandt. “Fears are being fanned and people are so angry with each other.” \nThe tone of public debate in Germany has become shriller over the past two years with the influx of hundreds of thousands of migrants. \nTwo Israeli tourists, on a visit to the German capital, seemed at a loss when asked about their wishes for 2017. “Peace on Earth. Just happiness, really,” said Nathan and Libat, declining to give their last names. \nWalking by the Reichstag, Germany’s Parliament building, Hamed Noori said 2016 had been a good year. “I came to Germany from Afghanistan,” he said. “Life is better here.” \nBirgitta Bergquist, a recent retiree visiting Berlin from Sweden, said she looked forward to spending more time with her three-year-old granddaughter. “And we hope the family stays healthy.” \nNicole Durand-Nusser, originally from France but living in Berlin for almost 50 years, said 2016 had been a difficult year: “Brexit, Trump, Erdogan — it’s all getting worse. \n“I’m a convinced European and I hope Europe doesn’t collapse in 2017,” she said. \nLater, police said they arrested a man who shouted “bomb, bomb, bomb” at Berlin’s massive open-air New Year’s party. \nUsing the hashtag “#nichtlustig”— meaning “not funny”— Berlin police tweeted Saturday that the unnamed man “is now celebrating #Welcome2017 with us.” \n——— \nTURKEY \nNeslihan Dogruol, a restaurant owner in a chic Istanbul neighbourhood, said she hopes for peace in 2017 following a year filled with “unrest and death.” \n“2016 affected everyone badly,” she said, referring to major attacks that hit Turkey in the past year. \nThe restaurant, adorned with snowflakes and tiny decorative lights for the evening, will have fewer people for dinner. “There is a serious gap between 2015 and 2016 in terms of business, people are going out less,” Dogruol said, adding that she expects more people to come for drinks. \nAt a commemoration for the 45 people killed in twin bombings on Dec. 10 in Istanbul, 38-year-old Murat Manoglu hoped for a better year ahead. “We lived through terrible days, we have lost many martyrs, many households suffered,” he said. \nSecurity measures were heightened in major Turkish cities. Traffic leading up to key squares in Istanbul and the capital, Ankara, will be closed, police said. In Istanbul, 17,000 police officers were on duty, some camouflaged as Santa Claus and others as street vendors, Turkey’s state-run Anadolu news agency reported on Friday. \nAnkara and Istanbul were targeted by bomb attacks in 2016, killing more than 180 people. Turkey has been in the throes of violence, combating the Islamic State group, Kurdish militants and a coup attempt blamed on the U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen. \n——— \nRUSSIA \nPresident Vladimir Putin invoked a bit of seasonal enchantment in his New Year’s Eve remarks to the nation. \n“Each of us may become something of a magician on the night of the New Year,” Putin said in a short televised address broadcast in the closing minutes of 2016 in each of Russia’s 11 time zones. \n“To do this we simply need to treat our parents with love and gratitude, take care of our children and families, respect our colleagues at work, nurture our friendships, defend truth and justice, be merciful and help those who are in need of support. This is the whole secret,” he said. \nNew Year’s Eve is Russia’s major gift-giving holiday, and big Russian cities were awash in festive lights and decorations. The Moscow subway offered a special holiday train, festooned with lights and artificial greenery. \n“I wish for the next year to better than this,” said rider Alexander Pisaryev. \n“We are waiting for good, for peace and order,” said another, Valentina Daineka. \n——— \nPARIS \nTourists and French revelers swarmed along Paris’ illuminated Champs Elysees Avenue on a frosty night, admiring the laser display from the Arc de Triomphe and lines of trees sparkling with lights. \n“It’s so magical to be here in Paris, on what people say is the world’s most beautiful avenue,” said Maureen O’Reilly, 42, a visitor from Belfast, Northern Ireland. \n“At times like this, I do think about all those terrible things in Aleppo and how lucky we are here in Europe despite everything,” she added. \nSome were happy to say goodbye to 2016. \n“It’s been such a horrible year, with all these (entertainment celebrity) deaths, Syria, Brexit and Trump. I say: good riddance,” said Karine Dublot, 38, from Lyon. \nOthers found a bright side. \n“My hope for 2017 is that we solve all the problems with the migrants here in France, and see the end of (President) Francois Hollande,” said Marc Valli, 35, from Paris. “We need someone who can sort out immigration as president.” \nHollande, who is not standing for re-election in the upcoming ballot, used his last New Year’s address to praise his country’s resilience in the face of deadly attacks in Nice and Saint-Etienne-du-Rouvray. \nHollande said French people could be proud for continuing “to live, work, go out, move around and cherish ... freedom.” \nPolice were out in force — with over 10,000 deployed in the French capital alone — and authorities said that “the passage to the New Year will take place in the context of a persistent and very high terrorist threat.” \n——— \nTHE VATICAN \nPope Francis has called on the faithful to help young people find a place in society, noting the paradox of “a culture that idolizes youth” and yet has made no place for the young. \nFrancis said during vespers marking New Year’s Eve that young people have been “pushed to the margins of public life, forcing them to migrate or to beg for jobs that no longer exist, or fail to promise them a future.” \nMore than responsibility, the pope said the world owed young people a debt, saying it has deprived them of “dignified and genuine work” that would allow them to take part in society, instead condemning them “to knock on doors that for the most part remain closed.” \n——— \nJAPAN \nTemple bells echoed at midnight as families gather around noodles and revelers flock to shrines for the biggest holiday in Japan. \n“I feel this sense of duality,” said Kami Miyamoto, 21, an economics student at Meiji University in Tokyo, who travelled home in Hakusan, Ishikawa prefecture, for the holiday. \n“The world is heading toward conservative insular policies,” she said of the U.S. election, Brexit and what she believes lies ahead for elections in Europe in 2017. “We learned about how valuable it is to get correct information.” \nOne of the most memorable experiences for Miyamoto in 2016 was a three-week study program in South Korea. She was surprised and moved by the friendship she formed with South Korean students, and she has decided to focus her studies on relations with South Korea. \n“Studying about the U.S. and Europe seems to be about looking at the past, but East Asian studies are focusing on the future,” she said. \nMiyamoto’s mother is preparing soba noodles, a standard New Year’s Eve dish in Japan, except in their home it will be filled with green onions and shrimp. As the new year rolls in, the entire family, including her younger brother and sister, will drive to a nearby shrine, which, like temples all over Japan, will be filled with those praying for good fortune in the Year of the Rooster, according to the Chinese zodiac. \n——— \nCHINA \nResidents in Beijing and Shanghai, China’s two largest cities, were passing New Year’s Eve quietly in a relative state of security lockdown, according to Chinese media reports citing police. \nThe Bund waterfront in Shanghai had no celebrations, authorities announced this week, while the sale, use and transportation of fireworks in central Shanghai will be prohibited altogether. Large buildings that often display light shows also stayed dark. More than 30 people died two years ago in a deadly stampede on Shanghai’s waterfront, where 300,000 people had gathered to watch a planned light show. \nBeijing police also said countdowns, light shows, lotteries and other organized activities will not be held in popular shopping districts such as Sanlitun and Guomao. Beijing police advised citizens to avoid crowded areas, closely watch elderly relatives and children, and be aware of exit routes in venues. \nChinese President Xi Jinping said in his annual New Year’s Eve address that his government will continue to focus on alleviating poverty at home and resolutely defending China’s territorial rights. \n——— \nSOUTH KOREA \nHundreds of thousands of South Koreans ushered in the new year with a massive protest demanding the resignation of disgraced President Park Geun-hye. It was the 10th straight weekend of protests that led to Park’s impeachment on Dec. 9 over a corruption scandal. \nThe evening rally was planned to overlap with Seoul’s traditional bell-tolling ceremony at the Bosinkgak pavilion at midnight, which was also expected to be a political statement against Park. \nThe city’s mayor, Park Won-soon, invited as guests a man whose teenage son was among more than 300 people who died during a 2014 ferry sinking, and a woman who was forced into sexual slavery by Japan’s Second World War military. \nPark Geun-hye came under heavy criticism over the way her government handled the ferry disaster. \n“So many unbelievable things happened in 2016. It didn’t feel real; if felt like a movie,” protester Lee Huymi said about the bizarre scandal that brought Park down. “So I hope 2017 brings a movie-like ending to the mess.” \n——— \nINDIA \nFor most people in India, New Year’s Eve is a time for family. In New Delhi and many other cities, newspapers are full of big advertisements for lavish parties at upscale hotels and restaurants. The big draws at the hotel parties are song and dance performances from Bollywood and television stars. \nThe western city of Mumbai will host big street parties with thousands of people at the iconic Gateway of India, a colonial-era structure on the waterfront overlooking the Arabian Sea. And there was talk about money — India’s recent devaluing of its currency in an apparent effort to cut graft and tax evasion. \n“2016 was boring but Modi brought about a twister near the end,” 18-year-old student Jugal Jadhwani said of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s announcement in early November. \n“It’s good for India,” he said. \nIt was a sentiment echoed by 42-year old Prasoon Verma. \n“2016 was good and with demonetization 2017 should be good for the Indian economy and India should move to the digital age,” he said. \n——— \nPHILIPPINES \nThe Philippines’ notorious tradition of dangerous New Year’s Eve celebrations persisted after President Rodrigo Duterte delayed to next year his ban on the use of powerful firecrackers, often worsened by celebratory gunfire. \nPowerful firecrackers and gunfire have maimed hundreds of people and killed some each year across the Philippines despite government crackdowns, an annual government scare campaign and efforts by officials to set up centralized fireworks displays, like on Saturday night. \nDuterte’s southern Davao City hasn’t been tainted by the bloody record because of a largely successful firecrackers ban he enforced when he was still the city’s crime-busting mayor. Last month, he said he would delay his plan to replicate his Davao ban nationwide by a year because many have already invested in firecrackers and he was concerned by the impact of an abrupt ban on poor Filipinos employed in the industry. \nBefore New Year’s Eve, the Department of Health said Saturday that 139 people had been injured by firecracker blasts in recent days, mostly children under 15. \n——— \nROMANIA \nNew Year’s is the biggest party of the year in Romania, and thousands flocked to the mountains to ski, hike and celebrate, some in the mood for fun, others anxious about global challenges in 2017. \nFormer Finance Minister Daniel Daianu, travelling to the mountain town of Sinaia, told The Associated Press that Western governments should pay closer attention to the public mood. \n“People are frustrated, people are resentful and people react,” he said. “Unless governments pay attention to fairness and fair play, we could see some very unpleasant surprises.” \nEarly Saturday, young Romanians roamed streets and trains, wearing peasant costumes and singing traditional songs about goats — a New Year symbol — while waving wands made of dried flowers. \nOne tradition was squelched this year. Police banned masked revelers in the northeastern village of Ruginoasa from staging a traditional fight between young men involving whips and bats after several people were injured a few years ago. \n——— \nUNITED ARAB EMIRATES \nIn Dubai, hundreds of thousands of people watched fireworks shoot from the sides of the world’s tallest building, the 828-metre (2,716-foot) Burj Khalifa. The show was also streamed live online. \nThere was no repeat of last year’s excitement, when police say faulty wiring sparked a fire several hours before midnight at The Address Downtown, a 63-storey skyscraper nearby. The high-rise tower still remains under repair. \nJust before the fireworks, private security guards stood every 50 metres (55 yards) as metal barriers blocked off sidewalks to keep the streets around the Burj Khalifa clear for roaming emergency vehicles, their strobe lights flashing in the darkness. \nWhile 2016 brought challenges across the world, those gathered to watch the fireworks in Dubai instead chose to focus on the positive. \nFor Ina Dumdum, 33, of Manila, Philippines, 2016 brought a new job in Abu Dhabi and greater economic security. Wearing a pink pair of do-it-yourself “Happy New Year” rabbit ears on her head, she smiled while saying she hoped for a baby in the New Year. “2016 was prosperity,” she said. \nTony Ngalande, 38, of Lilongwe, Malawi, also saw success in his automobile importing business. However, “2016 was full of a lot of surprises,” he said, mentioning the election of Donald Trump in the U.S. and the British vote to leave the European Union. \nNgalande laughed when asked if those surprises could portend anything negative for the new year. “So far so good,” he said with a smile.

Change text size for the story Print \nSex appeal doesn’t usually come to mind when it comes to North Korea. \nBut give the hermit kingdom and tubby tyrant Kim Jong-un credit for trying. \nThe communist stalwart has released their official 2017 calendar , featuring a bevvy of beautiful flight attendants. \nToiling for the nation’s air carrier, Air Koryo, the high-flying hotties are featured in a variety of airborne themes. \nAccording to the Daily Star, the calendar — very modest by western standards — was reportedly commissioned to boost North Korea’s tourist industry. \n“It is the first time a North Korean calendar carries photos of female flight attendants, way different from previous calendars that mostly carried bland photos of scenic views and cultural sites,” a source told Yonhap News. \nHammered by sanctions because of its aggressive nuclear program, North Korea is in desperate need of foreign currency. \nRecent reports have also suggested that there is growing unrest in the impoverished dictatorship.

      "text": "World markets ended 2016 mostly in the black   08:20 pm by AFP \nNew York, United States—Most world stocks markets finished 2016 in positive territory despite shock votes in Britain and the United States, but the outlook for 2017 is clouded by looming European elections and Brexit. \nThe year witnessed a wave of anti-establishment populism, which saw Britain vote to leave the EU and maverick billionaire businessman Donald Trump elected as US president. \nBoth unexpected outcomes sparked a brief tumble on global equity markets, but many have since staged a stunning recovery to finish 2016 in the black. \nLondon’s FTSE 100 gained 14.3 percent over the year, while Frankfurt’s DAX 30 added about 6.9 percent and the Paris CAC 40 won 4.9 percent. \nIn the US, all three major indices enjoyed robust gains, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumping 13.4 percent, the S&P 500 9.5 percent and the Nasdaq 7.5 percent. \nJapan’s Nikkei rose 0.4 percent in 2016, marking the fifth consecutive annual increase and registering its highest year-end close in two decades on optimism over the incoming US government. \nShanghai slumped more than 12 percent on the back of massive capital flight and a languishing yuan currency. \nEquities continued to receive support from robust central bank stimulus programs in Europe, Japan and elsewhere, although the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates in December and signaled it plans more tightening in 2017. \nA 50 percent jump in oil prices ­—fueled in part by the decision of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to cut production—also supported stocks. \nThat helped boost the Bovespa in Sao Paolo, which jumped nearly 40 percent on strength in commodity prices and the resolution of an impeachment drama involving former president Dilma Rousseff, which ended with the installation of center-right President Michel Temer in August. \nSince Brexit, London’s FTSE 100 blue-chip index has soared to end the year in record-breaking form, as the British economy shrugged off the impact of the impending divorce from the EU. \n“Fears of an imminent UK recession following Brexit proved wide of the mark thanks largely to the resilience of consumer spending,” NFS Macro analyst Nick Stamenkovic told AFP. \n“Indeed, Brexit was viewed as a local rather than global issue, prompting a sharp turnaround in the fortunes of world stock markets.” \nMarkets also briefly tanked on Nov. 9 after Republican Trump defeated Democrat and market favorite Hillary Clinton to capture the White House. \nYet Wall Street has since enjoyed a blockbuster run with the Dow Jones Industrial Average making a push towards 20,000 points. In the end, the blue-chip index finished at 19,762.60, logging its best year since 2013. \nNew York has been boosted by expectations that Trump—who will be inaugurated on Jan. 20—will honor election pledges to ramp up infrastructure spending, cut taxes and streamline regulations. \nMarkets are pricing in “all the good stuff while ignoring for now potential consequences for the dollar, deficits, interest rates, trade, inflation and the uncertainty principle,” JPMorgan Asset Management strategist Michael Cembalest said in a research note. \n“Whether this benign view is accurate or not will be a major driver of markets next year.” \nLooking ahead to 2017, the spotlight is now on upcoming European elections. \nThe Netherlands heads to the polls in March, followed by France in May, and Germany in the autumn. \nFurther gains by populist candidates would reverberate through Europe as Brussels moves into the thick of negotiations with Britain over Brexit. \nVTB Capital analyst Neil MacKinnon also highlighted the region’s banking problem after the European Central Bank called for Italian lender Monte dei Paschi di Siena (BMPS) to receive a bailout of 8.8 billion euros. \nItaly’s stock market shed 10 percent over the year. \nIn the US, investors largely have disregarded worries about the unpredictable Trump, including fears his tough posture towards China could lead to a trade war and that his embrace of Russian President Vladimir Putin could roil international alliances. \nBut reality could trump expectations. \nAnd expectations are high for Trump’s first 100 days, which are anticipated to include progress on these key policies, said Sandy Sanders, a senior portfolio manager at Manulife Asset Management. \n“Everyone is going to be laser-like focused on what’s going through Congress and the Senate and then to the president’s desk and they’re going to want to see deliverables on that tax reform,” Sanders said. \nIn foreign exchange, many economists predict the euro could slump to parity against the dollar next year, aided by the Federal Reserve’s hawkish stance on interest rates. \nThe Fed’s bullish outlook this month pushed the dollar to 10-month yen highs and sent it heading towards parity with the euro for the first time since 2002.",

      "text": "PM's 50-day 'Shuddhi Yajna' an uncontrolled forest fire: Congress IANS (File photo) \n\nTaking a dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Congress on Sunday said that his demonetisation step, which Modi dubbed as a \"Shuddhi Yajna\", was \"an uncontrolled forest fire\" that claimed over a 100 lives. \n\"The 50 days of so-called Shuddhi Yajna is nothing short of an uncontrolled forest fire that has taken a toll on 118 lives across the country and has crippled around 40 per cent of informal economy,\" senior Congress leader and former Maharashtra Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan told media persons here. He said the decision to scrap Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes has completely failed as \"almost all of the black money has been converted into white\".\"Why is government not giving any hard data over demonetisation, such as how much money has come back? What he gave at the end of 50 days is a mini budget speech...full of jingoistic appeal wrapped up in nationalistic fervour,\" Chavan said. Picking holes in Modi's speech delivered on the eve of New Year, Chavan pointed out that the sops announced by Modi for pregnant women was first started in November 2010 as a pilot project during the UPA regime and the initial amount of Rs 4,000 was hiked to Rs 6,000 in 2013.\"There was fear that the Prime Minister would unleash second surgical strike and announce further harsh measures in his fight against corruption,\" Chavan said.",

They say that at least 85 per cent of India’s currency is currently in those very bills the government has withdrawn. \nModi has insisted that the demonetization is an essential move to tackle graft in the country and crack down on black money – also referred to as unknown sources of income \nOn Saturday night, he said: “In this fight against corruption and black money, it is clear that you [the people] would like to walk shoulder to shoulder with us.” \n“For us in government, this is a blessing … Corruption, black money, and counterfeit notes had become so rampant in India’s social fabric, that even honest people were brought to their knees,” he added. \nModi also urged more to be done to aid the poir, farmers, and small businesses who have been challenged by the demonetisation reform. \nHe said that banks should do more to increase lending for the poor, and assist new homeowners to deal with borrowing interest rates. \n“Modi also said the government would increase credit guarantees for small businesses and provided additional incentives for digital transactions,” Reuters reported. \n ",

      "title": "Venezuela military trafficking food as country goes hungry",
      "text": "by Hannah Dreier And Joshua Goodman,   10:09 am MST \nPUERTO CABELLO, Venezuela – When hunger drew tens of thousands of Venezuelans to the streets in protest last summer, President Nicolas Maduro turned to the military to manage the country’s diminished food supply, putting generals in charge of everything from butter to rice. \nBut instead of fighting hunger, the military is making money from it, an Associated Press investigation shows. That’s what grocer Jose Campos found when he ran out of pantry staples this year. In the middle of the night, he would travel to an illegal market run by the military to buy pallets of corn flour — at 100 times the government-set price. \n“The military would be watching over whole bags of money,” Campos said. “They always had what I needed.” \nWith much of the country on the verge of starvation and billions of dollars at stake, food trafficking has become one of the biggest businesses in Venezuela, the AP found. And from generals to foot soldiers, the military is at the heart of the graft, according to documents and interviews with more than 60 officials, business owners and workers, including five former generals. \nAs a result, food is not reaching those who most need it. \nThe U.S. government has taken notice. Prosecutors have opened investigations against senior Venezuelan officials, including members of the military, for laundering riches from food contracts through the U.S. financial system, according to four people with direct knowledge of the probes. No charges have been brought. \n“Lately, food is a better business than drugs,” said retired Gen. Cliver Alcala, who helped oversee Venezuela’s border security. “The military is in charge of food management now, and they’re not going to just take that on without getting their cut.” \n“WHAT’S THE PROBLEM?” \nAfter opposition attempts to overthrow him, the late President Hugo Chavez began handing the military control over the food industry, creating a Food Ministry in 2004. His socialist-run government nationalized farms and food processing plants, then neglected them, and domestic production dried up. Oil-exporting Venezuela became dependent on food imports, but when the price of oil collapsed in 2014, the government no longer could afford all the country needed. \nFood rationing grew so severe that Venezuelans spent all day waiting in lines. Pediatric wards filled up with underweight children, and formerly middle class adults began picking through trash bins for scraps. When people responded with violent street protests, Maduro handed the generals control over the rest of food distribution, and the country’s ports. \nThe government now imports nearly all of Venezuela’s food, according to Werner Gutierrez, the former dean of the agronomy school at the University of Zulia, and corruption is rampant, jacking up prices and leading to shortages. \n“If Venezuela paid market prices, we’d be able to double our imports and easily satisfy the country’s food needs,” Gutierrez said. “Instead, people are starving.” \nOne South American businessman said he paid millions in kickbacks to Venezuelan officials as the hunger crisis worsened, including $8 million to people who work for the current food minister, Gen. Rodolfo Marco Torres. The businessman insisted on speaking anonymously because he did not want to acknowledge participating in corruption. \nLast July, he struggled to get Marco Torres’s attention as a ship full of yellow corn waited to dock. \n“This boat has been waiting for 20 days,” he wrote in text messages seen by AP. \n“What’s the problem?” responded Marco Torres. \nAlthough money was not mentioned, the businessman understood that he needed to give more in kickbacks. In the end, he told the general, the boat had to pull out because costs caused by the delay were mounting. \nBank documents from the businessman’s country show that he was a big supplier, receiving at least $131 million in contracts from Venezuelan food ministers between 2012 and 2015. He explained that vendors like him can afford to pay off military officials because they build huge profit margins into what they bill the state. \nFor example, his $52 million contract for the yellow corn was drawn up to be charged at more than double the market rate at the time, suggesting a potential overpayment of more than $20 million for that deal alone. \nThe Food Ministry’s annual report shows significant overpayments across the board, compared to market prices. And the prices the government pays for imported foods have been increasing in recent years, while global food prices remain stable. \nThis spring, the opposition-controlled congress voted to censure Marco Torres for graft. Maduro vetoed it as an attempt to hurt the Food Ministry, and Marco Torres stayed on as minister. \nInternal budgets from the ministry obtained by AP show the overpayment continues. For example, the government budgeted for $118 million of yellow corn in July at $357 a ton, which would amount to an overpayment of more than $50 million relative to prices that month. \n“What’s amazing about this is it’s like a clean form of corruption,” said Carabobo state lawmaker Neidy Rosal, who has denounced food-related government theft worth hundreds of millions of dollars. “It’s like drug trafficking you can carry out in broad daylight.” \nMarco Torres did not respond to several requests for comment by phone, email and hand-delivered letter. In the past, he has said that he will not be trapped in fights with a bourgeoisie opposition. \n“SCRAPING THE POT” \nBy putting the military in charge of food, Maduro is trying to prevent soldiers from going hungry and being tempted to participate in an uprising against an increasingly unpopular government, said retired Gen. Antonio Rivero. Venezuela’s military has a long history of coups against governments, and Maduro has arrested several officials for allegedly conspiring against him from within. \n“They gave absolute control to the military,” Rivero said from exile in Miami. “That drained the feeling of rebellion from the armed forces, and allowed them to feed their families.” \nHowever, it also opened the door to widespread graft and further squeezed the food supply. In large part due to concerns of corruption following the government’s takeover of the food industry, the three largest global food traders — U.S.-based Archer Daniels Midland Co., Bunge Ltd. and Cargill — have stopped selling to the Venezuelan government. \nOne major scam involves the strict currency controls that have been a hallmark of the administration. The government gives out a limited amount of coveted U.S. currency at a rate of 10 bolivars to the dollar. Almost everyone else has to buy dollars on the ever more expensive black market, currently at 3,000 bolivars to the dollar. \nThe holders of licenses to import food are among the select few who get to buy dollars at the vastly cheaper rate. Alcala, the retired general, said some officials distribute these much-desired licenses to friends. The friends then use only a fraction of the dollars to import food, and share the rest with the officials. \n“We call it ‘scraping the pot,’ and it’s the biggest scam going in Venezuela,” Alcala said. \nIn 2014, one general presented Maduro with a list of 300 companies suspected of simply pocketing the cheap dollars they obtained with their licenses and not importing anything. No action was ever taken and the general was forced into exile, accused of corruption himself. \nSome contracts go to companies that have no experience dealing in food or seem to exist only on paper. Financial documents obtained by AP show that Marco Torres gave Panama-registered company Atlas Systems International a $4.6 million contract to import pasta. Atlas has all the hallmarks of a shell company, including no known assets and the use of secretive shares to hide the identity of the company’s true owners. Another government food supplier, J.A. Comercio de Generos Alimenticios, lists on its website a non-existent address on a narrow, partially paved street in an industrial city near Sao Paulo, Brazil. \nThe two companies transferred more than $5.5 million in U.S. dollars in 2012 and 2013 to a Geneva account controlled by two young Venezuelans, according to bank and internal company documents seen by AP. The Venezuelans were Jesus Marquina Parra and Nestor Marquina Parra, brothers-in-law of the then-food minister, Gen. Carlos Osorio. Efforts to reach the brothers were unsuccessful. \nOsorio is no longer food minister, but has an even more important role in overseeing food. He was promoted in September to inspector general of the armed forces, with the mission of ensuring transparency in the military’s management of the nation’s food supply. \nArturo Sanchez, a former supply chain manager at a multinational dairy company, recounted unpleasant encounters with Osorio. In one case, officers forced the company to buy fructose it didn’t need because they wanted to unload merchandise he suspected was ill-gotten. Another time, he said, national guardsmen took four trucks of goods without paying. Sanchez fled to Florida in 2014. \n“I spent a year living in the U.S. not being able to sleep remembering all the risky situations I lived through,” he said. \nOsorio did not respond to requests for comment. But in the past he threatened to sue opposition lawmakers for staining his honour with false accusations of corruption. He blamed an economic war for the food shortages. \nThe Defence Ministry and presidential press office refused to answer repeated calls, emails and hand-delivered letters requesting comment. In the past, officials have accused the opposition of exaggerating the problem of corruption for political gain. They have said that the military’s hierarchical structure makes it ideally suited to combat the real culprits: Right-wing businessmen trying to bring down the economy. \nFrom time to time, the government carries out raids of warehouses holding smuggled goods and arrests lower-ranking military officers accused of graft. For example, the night market in Carabobo state where Campos bought his corn flour was eventually shut down and 57 tons of smuggled food seized. Now Campos buys staples from intermediaries he suspects are working with the same military officials. \nIn January, the government quietly arrested 40 state employees for stealing large quantities of food from open-air markets. One of those still in jail is a colonel who had been named by Osorio to serve as president of a state agency that imported food. \n“We have the moral fortitude and the discipline to take on this task of protecting what belongs to the people,” the defence minister, Gen. Vladimir Padrino Lopez, said in September. “The state has an obligation to root out corruption in all levels of public administration.” \n“IT’S THE CUSTOMER WHO PAYS” \nAnd yet the corruption persists from the port to the markets, according to dozens of people working in Puerto Cabello, the town that handles the majority of Venezuela’s food imports. \nSometimes the officials who control access to the docks keep ships waiting until they are paid off, said a stevedore at the port, who spoke anonymously because he feared losing his job. \nThe stevedore said clients give him envelopes of dollars to pass on to officials. He described visiting the sergeant in charge and making small talk while placing an envelope in the wastebasket. Then he slides the basket under the table and leaves. That night, his client’s ships are allowed in, he said. \nAfter ships unload their cargo, customs officials take their share, according to four customs workers. They said that without a payment equivalent to a month’s minimum wage, officials will not start the process of nationalizing goods. \nBribes are also required for any missing paperwork, and can exceed $10,000 for a single shipping container, customs worker Aldemar Diaz said. \n“Sometimes you actually want to do it legally, but the officials will say, ‘Don’t bother,'” he said. \nLuis Pena, operations director at the Caracas-based import business Premier Foods, said he pays off a long roster of military officials for each shipment of food he brings in from small-scale companies in the U.S. \n“You have to pay for them to even look at your cargo now,” he said. “It’s an unbroken chain of bribery from when your ship comes in until the food is driven out in trucks.” \nWorst of all, he added, is that he is forced to pay to skip a health inspection. Officials make him buy a health certificate and don’t even open the containers to test a sample, he said. \nA version of this process also takes place on the border, said Alcala, the retired general who was once in charge of border control. He said officers allowed smugglers to pay bribes to bring in food without proper health and safety checks. This year, Venezuelans began posting photos and videos showing magnets pulling tiny iron shavings out of freshly opened bags of sugar smuggled in from Brazil. \nPena said his contacts at the port have offered to illegally sell him government-imported staples like sugar and rice, complete with falsified papers and a military escort. \n“The military was supposed to step in and make sure the food got to the people, but it’s been the exact opposite,” said Pena, sitting in his warehouse. “They’ve made it into a business, and there’s no one to appeal to. In the end, it’s the customer who pays.” \nIf he tries to get through the process without bribes, he said, the food sits and spoils. \nRotting food is a problem even as 90 per cent of Venezuelans say they can’t afford enough to eat. In some cases, partners buy food that is about to expire at a steep discount, then bill the government for the full price. The government has sometimes acknowledged that food it imported arrived already expired. \nThe problem of rotting food got so bad at Puerto Cabello that it drew rebuke in the most recent state comptroller’s report, which expressed particular dismay that thousands of tons of state-imported beans had been allowed to spoil. \nWhen the food is no longer usable, the military tries to get rid of it quietly. Puerto Cabello crane operator Daniel Arteaga watched one night last winter as workers at a state-run warehouse buried hundreds of containers of spoiled chicken and meat imported by the government. \n“All these refrigerated containers, and meanwhile people are waiting in food lines each week just to buy a single chicken,” he said. \nPhotos taken at the Puerto Cabello dump last year show men in green military fatigues helping bury beef and chicken. Residents at a slum down the hill said after the military visits the dump, they dig up animal feed, potatoes, even ham to give their children. \nThe docks are hidden behind high concrete walls, and guards watch every entrance. AP gained rare access in November. The low-ranking military members assigned to guard the port can be seen collaborating with thieves to steal what little food comes in, according to eight people who work behind the walls. \n“You see people making off with whole sacks of flour or corn on their shoulders, and paying the guards on their way out,” logistics co-ordinator Nicole Mendoza said. “You see the money changing hands, and you just lower your eyes and don’t say anything.” \nLt. Miletsy Rodriguez, who is in charge of a group of national guardsmen running security at the port, said people are just looking to scapegoat the military. If her unit wasn’t around, looting would be even more widespread, she said. \n“The majority of us are doing our best. And sooner or later we’ll catch people who are not doing the job right,” she said. \nBRIBES ON THE ROAD \nJust as bribes are needed to get food into the port, they are also required to move food out, truckers said. \nThe roads near the port are lined with trucks waiting to be let in. Drivers sling hammocks in their wheel wells and sometimes wait several days in the thick tropical heat. Trucking bosses recently banded together to stop paying bribes to port officials, and the officials are now punishing them by delaying the movement of cargo onto vehicles, said Jose Petit, president of the Puerto Cabello trucking association. \nWhen the food is finally loaded onto the trucks, soldiers come by to take a cut. Photos and videos taken by truckers show officials taking sacks of sugar and coffee. As the trucks rattle off down the highway, hungry women in clothes that no longer fit chase after them to pick up anything that falls out. \nBillboards lining the highway feature a drawing of an enormous ant beside a nonworking phone number to denounce corruption, and the warning, “No to bachaqueros.” That’s what Venezuelans call people who make a living illegally reselling food, after the leafcutter ants that haul many times their weight through the jungles. \nOn the roads, truck drivers face an obstacle course of military checkpoints, ostensibly set up to stop bachaqueros. Truckers say soldiers at about half the checkpoints demand bribes. Some invent infractions such as an insufficiently filled tire, and take cash along with sacks of pantry items, produce and even live chickens, the drivers said. \n“It used to be you’d go your whole route and not have to pay any anything. Now at every checkpoint, they ask for 10,000 bolivars,” said trucker Henderson Rodriguez, who was waiting for a third day to get into the port to pick up a load of sugar. \nThe surest way to move food through the network of checkpoints is to transport it under military guard. For a percentage of the product’s value, military officers on the take will assign a moonlighting soldier to ride along in the truck, according to five store and restaurant owners. \nSugar and flour are among the items most in demand because they have become virtually impossible to find legally, and some businesses, like bakeries, cannot function without them. A half dozen bakery owners across the country said in interviews that military officials regularly approach them with offers to sell supplies in exchange for a bribe. \nIn the city of Valencia, bakery owner Jose Ferreira cuts two checks for each purchase of sugar: one for the official price of 2 cents a pound and one for the kickback of 60 cents of pound. He keeps copies of both checks in his books, seen by AP, in case the authorities ever come asking. \n“You make the legal payment, and then you pay the kickback,” he said. “We have no other option; there’s no substitute for sugar.” \nThe theft extends to the very end of the food supply chain, vendors said. At one market in Valencia, the military members who were appointed in August to stop contraband confiscated vendors’ produce. They said the vendors did not have the right permits. The food was piled in an olive green cargo truck. \nIn Puerto Cabello, hungry residents said it feels like corrupt soldiers are taking food off their children’s plates. Pedro Contreras, 74, watched more than 100 trucks carrying corn rattle onto the highway, and walked stiffly into traffic to sweep up the kernels that had sifted out. He planned to pound them into corn flour that night to feed his family. \n“The military is getting fat while my grandchildren get skinny,” he said. “All of Venezuela’s food comes through here, but so little of it goes to us.” \n___ \nAssociated Press writers Stan Lehman in Sao Paulo, Brazil, and Gisela Salomon in Miami contributed to this report. \n___ \nEXTRA: AP correspondent Hannah Dreier has been living through chaos this year as Venezuela edges toward collapse.

      "title": "Venezuela military trafficking food as country goes hungry",
      "text": "by Hannah Dreier And Joshua Goodman,   12:09 pm EST \nPUERTO CABELLO, Venezuela – When hunger drew tens of thousands of Venezuelans to the streets in protest last summer, President Nicolas Maduro turned to the military to manage the country’s diminished food supply, putting generals in charge of everything from butter to rice. \nBut instead of fighting hunger, the military is making money from it, an Associated Press investigation shows. That’s what grocer Jose Campos found when he ran out of pantry staples this year. In the middle of the night, he would travel to an illegal market run by the military to buy pallets of corn flour — at 100 times the government-set price. \n“The military would be watching over whole bags of money,” Campos said. “They always had what I needed.” \nWith much of the country on the verge of starvation and billions of dollars at stake, food trafficking has become one of the biggest businesses in Venezuela, the AP found. And from generals to foot soldiers, the military is at the heart of the graft, according to documents and interviews with more than 60 officials, business owners and workers, including five former generals. \nAs a result, food is not reaching those who most need it. \nThe U.S. government has taken notice. Prosecutors have opened investigations against senior Venezuelan officials, including members of the military, for laundering riches from food contracts through the U.S. financial system, according to four people with direct knowledge of the probes. No charges have been brought. \n“Lately, food is a better business than drugs,” said retired Gen. Cliver Alcala, who helped oversee Venezuela’s border security. “The military is in charge of food management now, and they’re not going to just take that on without getting their cut.” \n“WHAT’S THE PROBLEM?” \nAfter opposition attempts to overthrow him, the late President Hugo Chavez began handing the military control over the food industry, creating a Food Ministry in 2004. His socialist-run government nationalized farms and food processing plants, then neglected them, and domestic production dried up. Oil-exporting Venezuela became dependent on food imports, but when the price of oil collapsed in 2014, the government no longer could afford all the country needed. \nFood rationing grew so severe that Venezuelans spent all day waiting in lines. Pediatric wards filled up with underweight children, and formerly middle class adults began picking through trash bins for scraps. When people responded with violent street protests, Maduro handed the generals control over the rest of food distribution, and the country’s ports. \nThe government now imports nearly all of Venezuela’s food, according to Werner Gutierrez, the former dean of the agronomy school at the University of Zulia, and corruption is rampant, jacking up prices and leading to shortages. \n“If Venezuela paid market prices, we’d be able to double our imports and easily satisfy the country’s food needs,” Gutierrez said. “Instead, people are starving.” \nOne South American businessman said he paid millions in kickbacks to Venezuelan officials as the hunger crisis worsened, including $8 million to people who work for the current food minister, Gen. Rodolfo Marco Torres. The businessman insisted on speaking anonymously because he did not want to acknowledge participating in corruption. \nLast July, he struggled to get Marco Torres’s attention as a ship full of yellow corn waited to dock. \n“This boat has been waiting for 20 days,” he wrote in text messages seen by AP. \n“What’s the problem?” responded Marco Torres. \nAlthough money was not mentioned, the businessman understood that he needed to give more in kickbacks. In the end, he told the general, the boat had to pull out because costs caused by the delay were mounting. \nBank documents from the businessman’s country show that he was a big supplier, receiving at least $131 million in contracts from Venezuelan food ministers between 2012 and 2015. He explained that vendors like him can afford to pay off military officials because they build huge profit margins into what they bill the state. \nFor example, his $52 million contract for the yellow corn was drawn up to be charged at more than double the market rate at the time, suggesting a potential overpayment of more than $20 million for that deal alone. \nThe Food Ministry’s annual report shows significant overpayments across the board, compared to market prices. And the prices the government pays for imported foods have been increasing in recent years, while global food prices remain stable. \nThis spring, the opposition-controlled congress voted to censure Marco Torres for graft. Maduro vetoed it as an attempt to hurt the Food Ministry, and Marco Torres stayed on as minister. \nInternal budgets from the ministry obtained by AP show the overpayment continues. For example, the government budgeted for $118 million of yellow corn in July at $357 a ton, which would amount to an overpayment of more than $50 million relative to prices that month. \n“What’s amazing about this is it’s like a clean form of corruption,” said Carabobo state lawmaker Neidy Rosal, who has denounced food-related government theft worth hundreds of millions of dollars. “It’s like drug trafficking you can carry out in broad daylight.” \nMarco Torres did not respond to several requests for comment by phone, email and hand-delivered letter. In the past, he has said that he will not be trapped in fights with a bourgeoisie opposition. \n“SCRAPING THE POT” \nBy putting the military in charge of food, Maduro is trying to prevent soldiers from going hungry and being tempted to participate in an uprising against an increasingly unpopular government, said retired Gen. Antonio Rivero. Venezuela’s military has a long history of coups against governments, and Maduro has arrested several officials for allegedly conspiring against him from within. \n“They gave absolute control to the military,” Rivero said from exile in Miami. “That drained the feeling of rebellion from the armed forces, and allowed them to feed their families.” \nHowever, it also opened the door to widespread graft and further squeezed the food supply. In large part due to concerns of corruption following the government’s takeover of the food industry, the three largest global food traders — U.S.-based Archer Daniels Midland Co., Bunge Ltd. and Cargill — have stopped selling to the Venezuelan government. \nOne major scam involves the strict currency controls that have been a hallmark of the administration. The government gives out a limited amount of coveted U.S. currency at a rate of 10 bolivars to the dollar. Almost everyone else has to buy dollars on the ever more expensive black market, currently at 3,000 bolivars to the dollar. \nThe holders of licenses to import food are among the select few who get to buy dollars at the vastly cheaper rate. Alcala, the retired general, said some officials distribute these much-desired licenses to friends. The friends then use only a fraction of the dollars to import food, and share the rest with the officials. \n“We call it ‘scraping the pot,’ and it’s the biggest scam going in Venezuela,” Alcala said. \nIn 2014, one general presented Maduro with a list of 300 companies suspected of simply pocketing the cheap dollars they obtained with their licenses and not importing anything. No action was ever taken and the general was forced into exile, accused of corruption himself. \nSome contracts go to companies that have no experience dealing in food or seem to exist only on paper. Financial documents obtained by AP show that Marco Torres gave Panama-registered company Atlas Systems International a $4.6 million contract to import pasta. Atlas has all the hallmarks of a shell company, including no known assets and the use of secretive shares to hide the identity of the company’s true owners. Another government food supplier, J.A. Comercio de Generos Alimenticios, lists on its website a non-existent address on a narrow, partially paved street in an industrial city near Sao Paulo, Brazil. \nThe two companies transferred more than $5.5 million in U.S. dollars in 2012 and 2013 to a Geneva account controlled by two young Venezuelans, according to bank and internal company documents seen by AP. The Venezuelans were Jesus Marquina Parra and Nestor Marquina Parra, brothers-in-law of the then-food minister, Gen. Carlos Osorio. Efforts to reach the brothers were unsuccessful. \nOsorio is no longer food minister, but has an even more important role in overseeing food. He was promoted in September to inspector general of the armed forces, with the mission of ensuring transparency in the military’s management of the nation’s food supply. \nArturo Sanchez, a former supply chain manager at a multinational dairy company, recounted unpleasant encounters with Osorio. In one case, officers forced the company to buy fructose it didn’t need because they wanted to unload merchandise he suspected was ill-gotten. Another time, he said, national guardsmen took four trucks of goods without paying. Sanchez fled to Florida in 2014. \n“I spent a year living in the U.S. not being able to sleep remembering all the risky situations I lived through,” he said. \nOsorio did not respond to requests for comment. But in the past he threatened to sue opposition lawmakers for staining his honour with false accusations of corruption. He blamed an economic war for the food shortages. \nThe Defence Ministry and presidential press office refused to answer repeated calls, emails and hand-delivered letters requesting comment. In the past, officials have accused the opposition of exaggerating the problem of corruption for political gain. They have said that the military’s hierarchical structure makes it ideally suited to combat the real culprits: Right-wing businessmen trying to bring down the economy. \nFrom time to time, the government carries out raids of warehouses holding smuggled goods and arrests lower-ranking military officers accused of graft. For example, the night market in Carabobo state where Campos bought his corn flour was eventually shut down and 57 tons of smuggled food seized. Now Campos buys staples from intermediaries he suspects are working with the same military officials. \nIn January, the government quietly arrested 40 state employees for stealing large quantities of food from open-air markets. One of those still in jail is a colonel who had been named by Osorio to serve as president of a state agency that imported food. \n“We have the moral fortitude and the discipline to take on this task of protecting what belongs to the people,” the defence minister, Gen. Vladimir Padrino Lopez, said in September. “The state has an obligation to root out corruption in all levels of public administration.” \n“IT’S THE CUSTOMER WHO PAYS” \nAnd yet the corruption persists from the port to the markets, according to dozens of people working in Puerto Cabello, the town that handles the majority of Venezuela’s food imports. \nSometimes the officials who control access to the docks keep ships waiting until they are paid off, said a stevedore at the port, who spoke anonymously because he feared losing his job. \nThe stevedore said clients give him envelopes of dollars to pass on to officials. He described visiting the sergeant in charge and making small talk while placing an envelope in the wastebasket. Then he slides the basket under the table and leaves. That night, his client’s ships are allowed in, he said. \nAfter ships unload their cargo, customs officials take their share, according to four customs workers. They said that without a payment equivalent to a month’s minimum wage, officials will not start the process of nationalizing goods. \nBribes are also required for any missing paperwork, and can exceed $10,000 for a single shipping container, customs worker Aldemar Diaz said. \n“Sometimes you actually want to do it legally, but the officials will say, ‘Don’t bother,'” he said. \nLuis Pena, operations director at the Caracas-based import business Premier Foods, said he pays off a long roster of military officials for each shipment of food he brings in from small-scale companies in the U.S. \n“You have to pay for them to even look at your cargo now,” he said. “It’s an unbroken chain of bribery from when your ship comes in until the food is driven out in trucks.” \nWorst of all, he added, is that he is forced to pay to skip a health inspection. Officials make him buy a health certificate and don’t even open the containers to test a sample, he said. \nA version of this process also takes place on the border, said Alcala, the retired general who was once in charge of border control. He said officers allowed smugglers to pay bribes to bring in food without proper health and safety checks. This year, Venezuelans began posting photos and videos showing magnets pulling tiny iron shavings out of freshly opened bags of sugar smuggled in from Brazil. \nPena said his contacts at the port have offered to illegally sell him government-imported staples like sugar and rice, complete with falsified papers and a military escort. \n“The military was supposed to step in and make sure the food got to the people, but it’s been the exact opposite,” said Pena, sitting in his warehouse. “They’ve made it into a business, and there’s no one to appeal to. In the end, it’s the customer who pays.” \nIf he tries to get through the process without bribes, he said, the food sits and spoils. \nRotting food is a problem even as 90 per cent of Venezuelans say they can’t afford enough to eat. In some cases, partners buy food that is about to expire at a steep discount, then bill the government for the full price. The government has sometimes acknowledged that food it imported arrived already expired. \nThe problem of rotting food got so bad at Puerto Cabello that it drew rebuke in the most recent state comptroller’s report, which expressed particular dismay that thousands of tons of state-imported beans had been allowed to spoil. \nWhen the food is no longer usable, the military tries to get rid of it quietly. Puerto Cabello crane operator Daniel Arteaga watched one night last winter as workers at a state-run warehouse buried hundreds of containers of spoiled chicken and meat imported by the government. \n“All these refrigerated containers, and meanwhile people are waiting in food lines each week just to buy a single chicken,” he said. \nPhotos taken at the Puerto Cabello dump last year show men in green military fatigues helping bury beef and chicken. Residents at a slum down the hill said after the military visits the dump, they dig up animal feed, potatoes, even ham to give their children. \nThe docks are hidden behind high concrete walls, and guards watch every entrance. AP gained rare access in November. The low-ranking military members assigned to guard the port can be seen collaborating with thieves to steal what little food comes in, according to eight people who work behind the walls. \n“You see people making off with whole sacks of flour or corn on their shoulders, and paying the guards on their way out,” logistics co-ordinator Nicole Mendoza said. “You see the money changing hands, and you just lower your eyes and don’t say anything.” \nLt. Miletsy Rodriguez, who is in charge of a group of national guardsmen running security at the port, said people are just looking to scapegoat the military. If her unit wasn’t around, looting would be even more widespread, she said. \n“The majority of us are doing our best. And sooner or later we’ll catch people who are not doing the job right,” she said. \nBRIBES ON THE ROAD \nJust as bribes are needed to get food into the port, they are also required to move food out, truckers said. \nThe roads near the port are lined with trucks waiting to be let in. Drivers sling hammocks in their wheel wells and sometimes wait several days in the thick tropical heat. Trucking bosses recently banded together to stop paying bribes to port officials, and the officials are now punishing them by delaying the movement of cargo onto vehicles, said Jose Petit, president of the Puerto Cabello trucking association. \nWhen the food is finally loaded onto the trucks, soldiers come by to take a cut. Photos and videos taken by truckers show officials taking sacks of sugar and coffee. As the trucks rattle off down the highway, hungry women in clothes that no longer fit chase after them to pick up anything that falls out. \nBillboards lining the highway feature a drawing of an enormous ant beside a nonworking phone number to denounce corruption, and the warning, “No to bachaqueros.” That’s what Venezuelans call people who make a living illegally reselling food, after the leafcutter ants that haul many times their weight through the jungles. \nOn the roads, truck drivers face an obstacle course of military checkpoints, ostensibly set up to stop bachaqueros. Truckers say soldiers at about half the checkpoints demand bribes. Some invent infractions such as an insufficiently filled tire, and take cash along with sacks of pantry items, produce and even live chickens, the drivers said. \n“It used to be you’d go your whole route and not have to pay any anything. Now at every checkpoint, they ask for 10,000 bolivars,” said trucker Henderson Rodriguez, who was waiting for a third day to get into the port to pick up a load of sugar. \nThe surest way to move food through the network of checkpoints is to transport it under military guard. For a percentage of the product’s value, military officers on the take will assign a moonlighting soldier to ride along in the truck, according to five store and restaurant owners. \nSugar and flour are among the items most in demand because they have become virtually impossible to find legally, and some businesses, like bakeries, cannot function without them. A half dozen bakery owners across the country said in interviews that military officials regularly approach them with offers to sell supplies in exchange for a bribe. \nIn the city of Valencia, bakery owner Jose Ferreira cuts two checks for each purchase of sugar: one for the official price of 2 cents a pound and one for the kickback of 60 cents of pound. He keeps copies of both checks in his books, seen by AP, in case the authorities ever come asking. \n“You make the legal payment, and then you pay the kickback,” he said. “We have no other option; there’s no substitute for sugar.” \nThe theft extends to the very end of the food supply chain, vendors said. At one market in Valencia, the military members who were appointed in August to stop contraband confiscated vendors’ produce. They said the vendors did not have the right permits. The food was piled in an olive green cargo truck. \nIn Puerto Cabello, hungry residents said it feels like corrupt soldiers are taking food off their children’s plates. Pedro Contreras, 74, watched more than 100 trucks carrying corn rattle onto the highway, and walked stiffly into traffic to sweep up the kernels that had sifted out. He planned to pound them into corn flour that night to feed his family. \n“The military is getting fat while my grandchildren get skinny,” he said. “All of Venezuela’s food comes through here, but so little of it goes to us.” \n___ \nAssociated Press writers Stan Lehman in Sao Paulo, Brazil, and Gisela Salomon in Miami contributed to this report. \n___ \nEXTRA: AP correspondent Hannah Dreier has been living through chaos this year as Venezuela edges toward collapse.

      "text": "by Hannah Dreier And Joshua Goodman,   12:09 pm EST Last Updated Jan 1, 2017 at 12:40 pm EST \nPUERTO CABELLO, Venezuela – When hunger drew tens of thousands of Venezuelans to the streets in protest last summer, President Nicolas Maduro turned to the military to manage the country’s diminished food supply, putting generals in charge of everything from butter to rice. \nBut instead of fighting hunger, the military is making money from it, an Associated Press investigation shows. That’s what grocer Jose Campos found when he ran out of pantry staples this year. In the middle of the night, he would travel to an illegal market run by the military to buy pallets of corn flour — at 100 times the government-set price. \n“The military would be watching over whole bags of money,” Campos said. “They always had what I needed.” \nWith much of the country on the verge of starvation and billions of dollars at stake, food trafficking has become one of the biggest businesses in Venezuela, the AP found. And from generals to foot soldiers, the military is at the heart of the graft, according to documents and interviews with more than 60 officials, business owners and workers, including five former generals. \nAs a result, food is not reaching those who most need it. \nThe U.S. government has taken notice. Prosecutors have opened investigations against senior Venezuelan officials, including members of the military, for laundering riches from food contracts through the U.S. financial system, according to four people with direct knowledge of the probes. No charges have been brought. \n“Lately, food is a better business than drugs,” said retired Gen. Cliver Alcala, who helped oversee Venezuela’s border security. “The military is in charge of food management now, and they’re not going to just take that on without getting their cut.” \n“WHAT’S THE PROBLEM?” \nAfter opposition attempts to overthrow him, the late President Hugo Chavez began handing the military control over the food industry, creating a Food Ministry in 2004. His socialist-run government nationalized farms and food processing plants, then neglected them, and domestic production dried up. Oil-exporting Venezuela became dependent on food imports, but when the price of oil collapsed in 2014, the government no longer could afford all the country needed. \nFood rationing grew so severe that Venezuelans spent all day waiting in lines. Pediatric wards filled up with underweight children, and formerly middle class adults began picking through trash bins for scraps. When people responded with violent street protests, Maduro handed the generals control over the rest of food distribution, and the country’s ports. \nThe government now imports nearly all of Venezuela’s food, according to Werner Gutierrez, the former dean of the agronomy school at the University of Zulia, and corruption is rampant, jacking up prices and leading to shortages. \n“If Venezuela paid market prices, we’d be able to double our imports and easily satisfy the country’s food needs,” Gutierrez said. “Instead, people are starving.” \nOne South American businessman said he paid millions in kickbacks to Venezuelan officials as the hunger crisis worsened, including $8 million to people who work for the current food minister, Gen. Rodolfo Marco Torres. The businessman insisted on speaking anonymously because he did not want to acknowledge participating in corruption. \nLast July, he struggled to get Marco Torres’s attention as a ship full of yellow corn waited to dock. \n“This boat has been waiting for 20 days,” he wrote in text messages seen by AP. \n“What’s the problem?” responded Marco Torres. \nAlthough money was not mentioned, the businessman understood that he needed to give more in kickbacks. In the end, he told the general, the boat had to pull out because costs caused by the delay were mounting. \nBank documents from the businessman’s country show that he was a big supplier, receiving at least $131 million in contracts from Venezuelan food ministers between 2012 and 2015. He explained that vendors like him can afford to pay off military officials because they build huge profit margins into what they bill the state. \nFor example, his $52 million contract for the yellow corn was drawn up to be charged at more than double the market rate at the time, suggesting a potential overpayment of more than $20 million for that deal alone. \nThe Food Ministry’s annual report shows significant overpayments across the board, compared to market prices. And the prices the government pays for imported foods have been increasing in recent years, while global food prices remain stable. \nThis spring, the opposition-controlled congress voted to censure Marco Torres for graft. Maduro vetoed it as an attempt to hurt the Food Ministry, and Marco Torres stayed on as minister. \nInternal budgets from the ministry obtained by AP show the overpayment continues. For example, the government budgeted for $118 million of yellow corn in July at $357 a ton, which would amount to an overpayment of more than $50 million relative to prices that month. \n“What’s amazing about this is it’s like a clean form of corruption,” said Carabobo state lawmaker Neidy Rosal, who has denounced food-related government theft worth hundreds of millions of dollars. “It’s like drug trafficking you can carry out in broad daylight.” \nMarco Torres did not respond to several requests for comment by phone, email and hand-delivered letter. In the past, he has said that he will not be trapped in fights with a bourgeoisie opposition. \n“SCRAPING THE POT” \nBy putting the military in charge of food, Maduro is trying to prevent soldiers from going hungry and being tempted to participate in an uprising against an increasingly unpopular government, said retired Gen. Antonio Rivero. Venezuela’s military has a long history of coups against governments, and Maduro has arrested several officials for allegedly conspiring against him from within. \n“They gave absolute control to the military,” Rivero said from exile in Miami. “That drained the feeling of rebellion from the armed forces, and allowed them to feed their families.” \nHowever, it also opened the door to widespread graft and further squeezed the food supply. In large part due to concerns of corruption following the government’s takeover of the food industry, the three largest global food traders — U.S.-based Archer Daniels Midland Co., Bunge Ltd. and Cargill — have stopped selling to the Venezuelan government. \nOne major scam involves the strict currency controls that have been a hallmark of the administration. The government gives out a limited amount of coveted U.S. currency at a rate of 10 bolivars to the dollar. Almost everyone else has to buy dollars on the ever more expensive black market, currently at 3,000 bolivars to the dollar. \nThe holders of licenses to import food are among the select few who get to buy dollars at the vastly cheaper rate. Alcala, the retired general, said some officials distribute these much-desired licenses to friends. The friends then use only a fraction of the dollars to import food, and share the rest with the officials. \n“We call it ‘scraping the pot,’ and it’s the biggest scam going in Venezuela,” Alcala said. \nIn 2014, one general presented Maduro with a list of 300 companies suspected of simply pocketing the cheap dollars they obtained with their licenses and not importing anything. No action was ever taken and the general was forced into exile, accused of corruption himself. \nSome contracts go to companies that have no experience dealing in food or seem to exist only on paper. Financial documents obtained by AP show that Marco Torres gave Panama-registered company Atlas Systems International a $4.6 million contract to import pasta. Atlas has all the hallmarks of a shell company, including no known assets and the use of secretive shares to hide the identity of the company’s true owners. Another government food supplier, J.A. Comercio de Generos Alimenticios, lists on its website a non-existent address on a narrow, partially paved street in an industrial city near Sao Paulo, Brazil. \nThe two companies transferred more than $5.5 million in U.S. dollars in 2012 and 2013 to a Geneva account controlled by two young Venezuelans, according to bank and internal company documents seen by AP. The Venezuelans were Jesus Marquina Parra and Nestor Marquina Parra, brothers-in-law of the then-food minister, Gen. Carlos Osorio. Efforts to reach the brothers were unsuccessful. \nOsorio is no longer food minister, but has an even more important role in overseeing food. He was promoted in September to inspector general of the armed forces, with the mission of ensuring transparency in the military’s management of the nation’s food supply. \nArturo Sanchez, a former supply chain manager at a multinational dairy company, recounted unpleasant encounters with Osorio. In one case, officers forced the company to buy fructose it didn’t need because they wanted to unload merchandise he suspected was ill-gotten. Another time, he said, national guardsmen took four trucks of goods without paying. Sanchez fled to Florida in 2014. \n“I spent a year living in the U.S. not being able to sleep remembering all the risky situations I lived through,” he said. \nOsorio did not respond to requests for comment. But in the past he threatened to sue opposition lawmakers for staining his honour with false accusations of corruption. He blamed an economic war for the food shortages. \nThe Defence Ministry and presidential press office refused to answer repeated calls, emails and hand-delivered letters requesting comment. In the past, officials have accused the opposition of exaggerating the problem of corruption for political gain. They have said that the military’s hierarchical structure makes it ideally suited to combat the real culprits: Right-wing businessmen trying to bring down the economy. \nFrom time to time, the government carries out raids of warehouses holding smuggled goods and arrests lower-ranking military officers accused of graft. For example, the night market in Carabobo state where Campos bought his corn flour was eventually shut down and 57 tons of smuggled food seized. Now Campos buys staples from intermediaries he suspects are working with the same military officials. \nIn January, the government quietly arrested 40 state employees for stealing large quantities of food from open-air markets. One of those still in jail is a colonel who had been named by Osorio to serve as president of a state agency that imported food. \n“We have the moral fortitude and the discipline to take on this task of protecting what belongs to the people,” the defence minister, Gen. Vladimir Padrino Lopez, said in September. “The state has an obligation to root out corruption in all levels of public administration.” \n“IT’S THE CUSTOMER WHO PAYS” \nAnd yet the corruption persists from the port to the markets, according to dozens of people working in Puerto Cabello, the town that handles the majority of Venezuela’s food imports. \nSometimes the officials who control access to the docks keep ships waiting until they are paid off, said a stevedore at the port, who spoke anonymously because he feared losing his job. \nThe stevedore said clients give him envelopes of dollars to pass on to officials. He described visiting the sergeant in charge and making small talk while placing an envelope in the wastebasket. Then he slides the basket under the table and leaves. That night, his client’s ships are allowed in, he said. \nAfter ships unload their cargo, customs officials take their share, according to four customs workers. They said that without a payment equivalent to a month’s minimum wage, officials will not start the process of nationalizing goods. \nBribes are also required for any missing paperwork, and can exceed $10,000 for a single shipping container, customs worker Aldemar Diaz said. \n“Sometimes you actually want to do it legally, but the officials will say, ‘Don’t bother,'” he said. \nLuis Pena, operations director at the Caracas-based import business Premier Foods, said he pays off a long roster of military officials for each shipment of food he brings in from small-scale companies in the U.S. \n“You have to pay for them to even look at your cargo now,” he said. “It’s an unbroken chain of bribery from when your ship comes in until the food is driven out in trucks.” \nWorst of all, he added, is that he is forced to pay to skip a health inspection. Officials make him buy a health certificate and don’t even open the containers to test a sample, he said. \nA version of this process also takes place on the border, said Alcala, the retired general who was once in charge of border control. He said officers allowed smugglers to pay bribes to bring in food without proper health and safety checks. This year, Venezuelans began posting photos and videos showing magnets pulling tiny iron shavings out of freshly opened bags of sugar smuggled in from Brazil. \nPena said his contacts at the port have offered to illegally sell him government-imported staples like sugar and rice, complete with falsified papers and a military escort. \n“The military was supposed to step in and make sure the food got to the people, but it’s been the exact opposite,” said Pena, sitting in his warehouse. “They’ve made it into a business, and there’s no one to appeal to. In the end, it’s the customer who pays.” \nIf he tries to get through the process without bribes, he said, the food sits and spoils. \nRotting food is a problem even as 90 per cent of Venezuelans say they can’t afford enough to eat. In some cases, partners buy food that is about to expire at a steep discount, then bill the government for the full price. The government has sometimes acknowledged that food it imported arrived already expired. \nThe problem of rotting food got so bad at Puerto Cabello that it drew rebuke in the most recent state comptroller’s report, which expressed particular dismay that thousands of tons of state-imported beans had been allowed to spoil. \nWhen the food is no longer usable, the military tries to get rid of it quietly. Puerto Cabello crane operator Daniel Arteaga watched one night last winter as workers at a state-run warehouse buried hundreds of containers of spoiled chicken and meat imported by the government. \n“All these refrigerated containers, and meanwhile people are waiting in food lines each week just to buy a single chicken,” he said. \nPhotos taken at the Puerto Cabello dump last year show men in green military fatigues helping bury beef and chicken. Residents at a slum down the hill said after the military visits the dump, they dig up animal feed, potatoes, even ham to give their children. \nThe docks are hidden behind high concrete walls, and guards watch every entrance. AP gained rare access in November. The low-ranking military members assigned to guard the port can be seen collaborating with thieves to steal what little food comes in, according to eight people who work behind the walls. \n“You see people making off with whole sacks of flour or corn on their shoulders, and paying the guards on their way out,” logistics co-ordinator Nicole Mendoza said. “You see the money changing hands, and you just lower your eyes and don’t say anything.” \nLt. Miletsy Rodriguez, who is in charge of a group of national guardsmen running security at the port, said people are just looking to scapegoat the military. If her unit wasn’t around, looting would be even more widespread, she said. \n“The majority of us are doing our best. And sooner or later we’ll catch people who are not doing the job right,” she said. \nBRIBES ON THE ROAD \nJust as bribes are needed to get food into the port, they are also required to move food out, truckers said. \nThe roads near the port are lined with trucks waiting to be let in. Drivers sling hammocks in their wheel wells and sometimes wait several days in the thick tropical heat. Trucking bosses recently banded together to stop paying bribes to port officials, and the officials are now punishing them by delaying the movement of cargo onto vehicles, said Jose Petit, president of the Puerto Cabello trucking association. \nWhen the food is finally loaded onto the trucks, soldiers come by to take a cut. Photos and videos taken by truckers show officials taking sacks of sugar and coffee. As the trucks rattle off down the highway, hungry women in clothes that no longer fit chase after them to pick up anything that falls out. \nBillboards lining the highway feature a drawing of an enormous ant beside a nonworking phone number to denounce corruption, and the warning, “No to bachaqueros.” That’s what Venezuelans call people who make a living illegally reselling food, after the leafcutter ants that haul many times their weight through the jungles. \nOn the roads, truck drivers face an obstacle course of military checkpoints, ostensibly set up to stop bachaqueros. Truckers say soldiers at about half the checkpoints demand bribes. Some invent infractions such as an insufficiently filled tire, and take cash along with sacks of pantry items, produce and even live chickens, the drivers said. \n“It used to be you’d go your whole route and not have to pay any anything. Now at every checkpoint, they ask for 10,000 bolivars,” said trucker Henderson Rodriguez, who was waiting for a third day to get into the port to pick up a load of sugar. \nThe surest way to move food through the network of checkpoints is to transport it under military guard. For a percentage of the product’s value, military officers on the take will assign a moonlighting soldier to ride along in the truck, according to five store and restaurant owners. \nSugar and flour are among the items most in demand because they have become virtually impossible to find legally, and some businesses, like bakeries, cannot function without them. A half dozen bakery owners across the country said in interviews that military officials regularly approach them with offers to sell supplies in exchange for a bribe. \nIn the city of Valencia, bakery owner Jose Ferreira cuts two checks for each purchase of sugar: one for the official price of 2 cents a pound and one for the kickback of 60 cents of pound. He keeps copies of both checks in his books, seen by AP, in case the authorities ever come asking. \n“You make the legal payment, and then you pay the kickback,” he said. “We have no other option; there’s no substitute for sugar.” \nThe theft extends to the very end of the food supply chain, vendors said. At one market in Valencia, the military members who were appointed in August to stop contraband confiscated vendors’ produce. They said the vendors did not have the right permits. The food was piled in an olive green cargo truck. \nIn Puerto Cabello, hungry residents said it feels like corrupt soldiers are taking food off their children’s plates. Pedro Contreras, 74, watched more than 100 trucks carrying corn rattle onto the highway, and walked stiffly into traffic to sweep up the kernels that had sifted out. He planned to pound them into corn flour that night to feed his family. \n“The military is getting fat while my grandchildren get skinny,” he said. “All of Venezuela’s food comes through here, but so little of it goes to us.” \n___ \nAssociated Press writers Stan Lehman in Sao Paulo, Brazil, and Gisela Salomon in Miami contributed to this report. \n___ \nEXTRA: AP correspondent Hannah Dreier has been living through chaos this year as Venezuela edges toward collapse.

      "text": "5 A study revealed that traditional New Year resolutions have been replaced by modern life changes. During the past four decades, I had promised myself a number of resolutions like reading more and saving money, on the first day of every New Year and stuck to them which helped to live a peaceful life. One thing is certain that those who have passion for the work that they do, the more likely they are to demonstrate positive energy and success in life. In Focus The idea behind making, thinking or writing down our resolutions is to keep the positive momentum rolling into the next season.\nGone are the days when people used to make typical resolutions like giving up smoking or alcohol being thriftier with money. \nBut at the same time, some youngsters take the same resolutions every New Year eve, but fail to abide by them. Well, if some youngsters are to be believed, corny New Year. I have been making resolutions every year but keep failing miserably each time. \nI am very fond of wearing full-sleeve shirts and almost have of every design – stripes, checks, plain of different brands. When my daughter counted down in 1996, I had around two hundred. I promised myself not to go in for new ones for full one year by keeping a hand written slip in my purse which had been reminding me all the time while opening the purse or passing from near the showroom displayed with new designed shirts. But I stuck to that for the next year and saved a lot during that particular year. \nThere was another friend of mine whose New Year resolution in 80s was to stop drinking but he used that as a pretext to go on a binge on New Year's Eve. He wanted to drink hard for the last time in his life despite suffering from jaundice and being stopped by the doctor, but his promise barely sustained for a couple of weeks into the New Year. \nI also recall to mind that I completed the last line of the couplet in a gazhal after the incident – \"Maut Ko Jis Ne Kareeb Se Hai Dekha, Laksh Zindgi Ka Kuch Nazar Na Aaya – Those who have seen death so closely, could not find the targets in life\". \nThose who make promises with themselves or had to by virtue of some, hardly put up with by them except one of my friends to whom I used to call with love Shubi, who fulfilled to remain straight forward with me on any issue. But now a days the resolutions no longer find favour with the current generation. \nFrankly speaking, normally, I don't agree that New Year is an occasion for one to start life afresh and stuff. In fact, for some, it is just another excuse to spoil themselves silly. \nLet me share with you as to what is so special about New Year this time for me? \nBut with the declaration of demonetisation by our Prime Minister as a part of putting a complete check over the black money - which I don't have - as I deposited the entire Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 currency notes with me, on the next day of the announcement. On the New Year's Day, I had promised to enter into the digital monetisation world by using maximum plastic money which is equally good and safe in my hands, for which the infrastructure has been made available for swapping the cards even by small vendors.",

      "title": "Venezuela military trafficking food as country goes hungry",
      "text": "by Hannah Dreier And Joshua Goodman, The Associated Press Posted Jan 1, 2017 10:09   10:40 am MST \nPUERTO CABELLO, Venezuela – When hunger drew tens of thousands of Venezuelans to the streets in protest last summer, President Nicolas Maduro turned to the military to manage the country’s diminished food supply, putting generals in charge of everything from butter to rice. \nBut instead of fighting hunger, the military is making money from it, an Associated Press investigation shows. That’s what grocer Jose Campos found when he ran out of pantry staples this year. In the middle of the night, he would travel to an illegal market run by the military to buy pallets of corn flour — at 100 times the government-set price. \n“The military would be watching over whole bags of money,” Campos said. “They always had what I needed.” \nWith much of the country on the verge of starvation and billions of dollars at stake, food trafficking has become one of the biggest businesses in Venezuela, the AP found. And from generals to foot soldiers, the military is at the heart of the graft, according to documents and interviews with more than 60 officials, business owners and workers, including five former generals. \nAs a result, food is not reaching those who most need it. \nThe U.S. government has taken notice. Prosecutors have opened investigations against senior Venezuelan officials, including members of the military, for laundering riches from food contracts through the U.S. financial system, according to four people with direct knowledge of the probes. No charges have been brought. \n“Lately, food is a better business than drugs,” said retired Gen. Cliver Alcala, who helped oversee Venezuela’s border security. “The military is in charge of food management now, and they’re not going to just take that on without getting their cut.” \n“WHAT’S THE PROBLEM?” \nAfter opposition attempts to overthrow him, the late President Hugo Chavez began handing the military control over the food industry, creating a Food Ministry in 2004. His socialist-run government nationalized farms and food processing plants, then neglected them, and domestic production dried up. Oil-exporting Venezuela became dependent on food imports, but when the price of oil collapsed in 2014, the government no longer could afford all the country needed. \nFood rationing grew so severe that Venezuelans spent all day waiting in lines. Pediatric wards filled up with underweight children, and formerly middle class adults began picking through trash bins for scraps. When people responded with violent street protests, Maduro handed the generals control over the rest of food distribution, and the country’s ports. \nThe government now imports nearly all of Venezuela’s food, according to Werner Gutierrez, the former dean of the agronomy school at the University of Zulia, and corruption is rampant, jacking up prices and leading to shortages. \n“If Venezuela paid market prices, we’d be able to double our imports and easily satisfy the country’s food needs,” Gutierrez said. “Instead, people are starving.” \nOne South American businessman said he paid millions in kickbacks to Venezuelan officials as the hunger crisis worsened, including $8 million to people who work for the current food minister, Gen. Rodolfo Marco Torres. The businessman insisted on speaking anonymously because he did not want to acknowledge participating in corruption. \nLast July, he struggled to get Marco Torres’s attention as a ship full of yellow corn waited to dock. \n“This boat has been waiting for 20 days,” he wrote in text messages seen by AP. \n“What’s the problem?” responded Marco Torres. \nAlthough money was not mentioned, the businessman understood that he needed to give more in kickbacks. In the end, he told the general, the boat had to pull out because costs caused by the delay were mounting. \nBank documents from the businessman’s country show that he was a big supplier, receiving at least $131 million in contracts from Venezuelan food ministers between 2012 and 2015. He explained that vendors like him can afford to pay off military officials because they build huge profit margins into what they bill the state. \nFor example, his $52 million contract for the yellow corn was drawn up to be charged at more than double the market rate at the time, suggesting a potential overpayment of more than $20 million for that deal alone. \nThe Food Ministry’s annual report shows significant overpayments across the board, compared to market prices. And the prices the government pays for imported foods have been increasing in recent years, while global food prices remain stable. \nThis spring, the opposition-controlled congress voted to censure Marco Torres for graft. Maduro vetoed it as an attempt to hurt the Food Ministry, and Marco Torres stayed on as minister. \nInternal budgets from the ministry obtained by AP show the overpayment continues. For example, the government budgeted for $118 million of yellow corn in July at $357 a ton, which would amount to an overpayment of more than $50 million relative to prices that month. \n“What’s amazing about this is it’s like a clean form of corruption,” said Carabobo state lawmaker Neidy Rosal, who has denounced food-related government theft worth hundreds of millions of dollars. “It’s like drug trafficking you can carry out in broad daylight.” \nMarco Torres did not respond to several requests for comment by phone, email and hand-delivered letter. In the past, he has said that he will not be trapped in fights with a bourgeoisie opposition. \n“SCRAPING THE POT” \nBy putting the military in charge of food, Maduro is trying to prevent soldiers from going hungry and being tempted to participate in an uprising against an increasingly unpopular government, said retired Gen. Antonio Rivero. Venezuela’s military has a long history of coups against governments, and Maduro has arrested several officials for allegedly conspiring against him from within. \n“They gave absolute control to the military,” Rivero said from exile in Miami. “That drained the feeling of rebellion from the armed forces, and allowed them to feed their families.” \nHowever, it also opened the door to widespread graft and further squeezed the food supply. In large part due to concerns of corruption following the government’s takeover of the food industry, the three largest global food traders — U.S.-based Archer Daniels Midland Co., Bunge Ltd. and Cargill — have stopped selling to the Venezuelan government. \nOne major scam involves the strict currency controls that have been a hallmark of the administration. The government gives out a limited amount of coveted U.S. currency at a rate of 10 bolivars to the dollar. Almost everyone else has to buy dollars on the ever more expensive black market, currently at 3,000 bolivars to the dollar. \nThe holders of licenses to import food are among the select few who get to buy dollars at the vastly cheaper rate. Alcala, the retired general, said some officials distribute these much-desired licenses to friends. The friends then use only a fraction of the dollars to import food, and share the rest with the officials. \n“We call it ‘scraping the pot,’ and it’s the biggest scam going in Venezuela,” Alcala said. \nIn 2014, one general presented Maduro with a list of 300 companies suspected of simply pocketing the cheap dollars they obtained with their licenses and not importing anything. No action was ever taken and the general was forced into exile, accused of corruption himself. \nSome contracts go to companies that have no experience dealing in food or seem to exist only on paper. Financial documents obtained by AP show that Marco Torres gave Panama-registered company Atlas Systems International a $4.6 million contract to import pasta. Atlas has all the hallmarks of a shell company, including no known assets and the use of secretive shares to hide the identity of the company’s true owners. Another government food supplier, J.A. Comercio de Generos Alimenticios, lists on its website a non-existent address on a narrow, partially paved street in an industrial city near Sao Paulo, Brazil. \nThe two companies transferred more than $5.5 million in U.S. dollars in 2012 and 2013 to a Geneva account controlled by two young Venezuelans, according to bank and internal company documents seen by AP. The Venezuelans were Jesus Marquina Parra and Nestor Marquina Parra, brothers-in-law of the then-food minister, Gen. Carlos Osorio. Efforts to reach the brothers were unsuccessful. \nOsorio is no longer food minister, but has an even more important role in overseeing food. He was promoted in September to inspector general of the armed forces, with the mission of ensuring transparency in the military’s management of the nation’s food supply. \nArturo Sanchez, a former supply chain manager at a multinational dairy company, recounted unpleasant encounters with Osorio. In one case, officers forced the company to buy fructose it didn’t need because they wanted to unload merchandise he suspected was ill-gotten. Another time, he said, national guardsmen took four trucks of goods without paying. Sanchez fled to Florida in 2014. \n“I spent a year living in the U.S. not being able to sleep remembering all the risky situations I lived through,” he said. \nOsorio did not respond to requests for comment. But in the past he threatened to sue opposition lawmakers for staining his honour with false accusations of corruption. He blamed an economic war for the food shortages. \nThe Defence Ministry and presidential press office refused to answer repeated calls, emails and hand-delivered letters requesting comment. In the past, officials have accused the opposition of exaggerating the problem of corruption for political gain. They have said that the military’s hierarchical structure makes it ideally suited to combat the real culprits: Right-wing businessmen trying to bring down the economy. \nFrom time to time, the government carries out raids of warehouses holding smuggled goods and arrests lower-ranking military officers accused of graft. For example, the night market in Carabobo state where Campos bought his corn flour was eventually shut down and 57 tons of smuggled food seized. Now Campos buys staples from intermediaries he suspects are working with the same military officials. \nIn January, the government quietly arrested 40 state employees for stealing large quantities of food from open-air markets. One of those still in jail is a colonel who had been named by Osorio to serve as president of a state agency that imported food. \n“We have the moral fortitude and the discipline to take on this task of protecting what belongs to the people,” the defence minister, Gen. Vladimir Padrino Lopez, said in September. “The state has an obligation to root out corruption in all levels of public administration.” \n“IT’S THE CUSTOMER WHO PAYS” \nAnd yet the corruption persists from the port to the markets, according to dozens of people working in Puerto Cabello, the town that handles the majority of Venezuela’s food imports. \nSometimes the officials who control access to the docks keep ships waiting until they are paid off, said a stevedore at the port, who spoke anonymously because he feared losing his job. \nThe stevedore said clients give him envelopes of dollars to pass on to officials. He described visiting the sergeant in charge and making small talk while placing an envelope in the wastebasket. Then he slides the basket under the table and leaves. That night, his client’s ships are allowed in, he said. \nAfter ships unload their cargo, customs officials take their share, according to four customs workers. They said that without a payment equivalent to a month’s minimum wage, officials will not start the process of nationalizing goods. \nBribes are also required for any missing paperwork, and can exceed $10,000 for a single shipping container, customs worker Aldemar Diaz said. \n“Sometimes you actually want to do it legally, but the officials will say, ‘Don’t bother,'” he said. \nLuis Pena, operations director at the Caracas-based import business Premier Foods, said he pays off a long roster of military officials for each shipment of food he brings in from small-scale companies in the U.S. \n“You have to pay for them to even look at your cargo now,” he said. “It’s an unbroken chain of bribery from when your ship comes in until the food is driven out in trucks.” \nWorst of all, he added, is that he is forced to pay to skip a health inspection. Officials make him buy a health certificate and don’t even open the containers to test a sample, he said. \nA version of this process also takes place on the border, said Alcala, the retired general who was once in charge of border control. He said officers allowed smugglers to pay bribes to bring in food without proper health and safety checks. This year, Venezuelans began posting photos and videos showing magnets pulling tiny iron shavings out of freshly opened bags of sugar smuggled in from Brazil. \nPena said his contacts at the port have offered to illegally sell him government-imported staples like sugar and rice, complete with falsified papers and a military escort. \n“The military was supposed to step in and make sure the food got to the people, but it’s been the exact opposite,” said Pena, sitting in his warehouse. “They’ve made it into a business, and there’s no one to appeal to. In the end, it’s the customer who pays.” \nIf he tries to get through the process without bribes, he said, the food sits and spoils. \nRotting food is a problem even as 90 per cent of Venezuelans say they can’t afford enough to eat. In some cases, partners buy food that is about to expire at a steep discount, then bill the government for the full price. The government has sometimes acknowledged that food it imported arrived already expired. \nThe problem of rotting food got so bad at Puerto Cabello that it drew rebuke in the most recent state comptroller’s report, which expressed particular dismay that thousands of tons of state-imported beans had been allowed to spoil. \nWhen the food is no longer usable, the military tries to get rid of it quietly. Puerto Cabello crane operator Daniel Arteaga watched one night last winter as workers at a state-run warehouse buried hundreds of containers of spoiled chicken and meat imported by the government. \n“All these refrigerated containers, and meanwhile people are waiting in food lines each week just to buy a single chicken,” he said. \nPhotos taken at the Puerto Cabello dump last year show men in green military fatigues helping bury beef and chicken. Residents at a slum down the hill said after the military visits the dump, they dig up animal feed, potatoes, even ham to give their children. \nThe docks are hidden behind high concrete walls, and guards watch every entrance. AP gained rare access in November. The low-ranking military members assigned to guard the port can be seen collaborating with thieves to steal what little food comes in, according to eight people who work behind the walls. \n“You see people making off with whole sacks of flour or corn on their shoulders, and paying the guards on their way out,” logistics co-ordinator Nicole Mendoza said. “You see the money changing hands, and you just lower your eyes and don’t say anything.” \nLt. Miletsy Rodriguez, who is in charge of a group of national guardsmen running security at the port, said people are just looking to scapegoat the military. If her unit wasn’t around, looting would be even more widespread, she said. \n“The majority of us are doing our best. And sooner or later we’ll catch people who are not doing the job right,” she said. \nBRIBES ON THE ROAD \nJust as bribes are needed to get food into the port, they are also required to move food out, truckers said. \nThe roads near the port are lined with trucks waiting to be let in. Drivers sling hammocks in their wheel wells and sometimes wait several days in the thick tropical heat. Trucking bosses recently banded together to stop paying bribes to port officials, and the officials are now punishing them by delaying the movement of cargo onto vehicles, said Jose Petit, president of the Puerto Cabello trucking association. \nWhen the food is finally loaded onto the trucks, soldiers come by to take a cut. Photos and videos taken by truckers show officials taking sacks of sugar and coffee. As the trucks rattle off down the highway, hungry women in clothes that no longer fit chase after them to pick up anything that falls out. \nBillboards lining the highway feature a drawing of an enormous ant beside a nonworking phone number to denounce corruption, and the warning, “No to bachaqueros.” That’s what Venezuelans call people who make a living illegally reselling food, after the leafcutter ants that haul many times their weight through the jungles. \nOn the roads, truck drivers face an obstacle course of military checkpoints, ostensibly set up to stop bachaqueros. Truckers say soldiers at about half the checkpoints demand bribes. Some invent infractions such as an insufficiently filled tire, and take cash along with sacks of pantry items, produce and even live chickens, the drivers said. \n“It used to be you’d go your whole route and not have to pay any anything. Now at every checkpoint, they ask for 10,000 bolivars,” said trucker Henderson Rodriguez, who was waiting for a third day to get into the port to pick up a load of sugar. \nThe surest way to move food through the network of checkpoints is to transport it under military guard. For a percentage of the product’s value, military officers on the take will assign a moonlighting soldier to ride along in the truck, according to five store and restaurant owners. \nSugar and flour are among the items most in demand because they have become virtually impossible to find legally, and some businesses, like bakeries, cannot function without them. A half dozen bakery owners across the country said in interviews that military officials regularly approach them with offers to sell supplies in exchange for a bribe. \nIn the city of Valencia, bakery owner Jose Ferreira cuts two checks for each purchase of sugar: one for the official price of 2 cents a pound and one for the kickback of 60 cents of pound. He keeps copies of both checks in his books, seen by AP, in case the authorities ever come asking. \n“You make the legal payment, and then you pay the kickback,” he said. “We have no other option; there’s no substitute for sugar.” \nThe theft extends to the very end of the food supply chain, vendors said. At one market in Valencia, the military members who were appointed in August to stop contraband confiscated vendors’ produce. They said the vendors did not have the right permits. The food was piled in an olive green cargo truck. \nIn Puerto Cabello, hungry residents said it feels like corrupt soldiers are taking food off their children’s plates. Pedro Contreras, 74, watched more than 100 trucks carrying corn rattle onto the highway, and walked stiffly into traffic to sweep up the kernels that had sifted out. He planned to pound them into corn flour that night to feed his family. \n“The military is getting fat while my grandchildren get skinny,” he said. “All of Venezuela’s food comes through here, but so little of it goes to us.” \n___ \nAssociated Press writers Stan Lehman in Sao Paulo, Brazil, and Gisela Salomon in Miami contributed to this report. \n___ \nEXTRA: AP correspondent Hannah Dreier has been living through chaos this year as Venezuela edges toward collapse.

      "text": "by Hannah Dreier And Joshua Goodman, The Associated Press Posted Jan 1, 2017 9:09 am PST Last Updated Jan 1, 2017 at 9:40 am PST In this Nov. 1, 2016 photo, a man carries bags of recyclable material he collected at the dump in Puerto Cabello, Venezuela, the port city where the majority of the country's imported food arrives. When imported food goes bad at the port, the military tries to get rid of it quietly by burying it at dumps like this one. Residents say they've been able to recover oats, sunflower seeds, and pig feed dumped by the military this year. (AP Photo/Ariana Cubillos) \nPUERTO CABELLO, Venezuela – When hunger drew tens of thousands of Venezuelans to the streets in protest last summer, President Nicolas Maduro turned to the military to manage the country’s diminished food supply, putting generals in charge of everything from butter to rice. \nBut instead of fighting hunger, the military is making money from it, an Associated Press investigation shows. That’s what grocer Jose Campos found when he ran out of pantry staples this year. In the middle of the night, he would travel to an illegal market run by the military to buy pallets of corn flour — at 100 times the government-set price. \n“The military would be watching over whole bags of money,” Campos said. “They always had what I needed.” \nWith much of the country on the verge of starvation and billions of dollars at stake, food trafficking has become one of the biggest businesses in Venezuela, the AP found. And from generals to foot soldiers, the military is at the heart of the graft, according to documents and interviews with more than 60 officials, business owners and workers, including five former generals. \nAs a result, food is not reaching those who most need it. \nThe U.S. government has taken notice. Prosecutors have opened investigations against senior Venezuelan officials, including members of the military, for laundering riches from food contracts through the U.S. financial system, according to four people with direct knowledge of the probes. No charges have been brought. \n“Lately, food is a better business than drugs,” said retired Gen. Cliver Alcala, who helped oversee Venezuela’s border security. “The military is in charge of food management now, and they’re not going to just take that on without getting their cut.” \n“WHAT’S THE PROBLEM?” \nAfter opposition attempts to overthrow him, the late President Hugo Chavez began handing the military control over the food industry, creating a Food Ministry in 2004. His socialist-run government nationalized farms and food processing plants, then neglected them, and domestic production dried up. Oil-exporting Venezuela became dependent on food imports, but when the price of oil collapsed in 2014, the government no longer could afford all the country needed. \nFood rationing grew so severe that Venezuelans spent all day waiting in lines. Pediatric wards filled up with underweight children, and formerly middle class adults began picking through trash bins for scraps. When people responded with violent street protests, Maduro handed the generals control over the rest of food distribution, and the country’s ports. \nThe government now imports nearly all of Venezuela’s food, according to Werner Gutierrez, the former dean of the agronomy school at the University of Zulia, and corruption is rampant, jacking up prices and leading to shortages. \n“If Venezuela paid market prices, we’d be able to double our imports and easily satisfy the country’s food needs,” Gutierrez said. “Instead, people are starving.” \nOne South American businessman said he paid millions in kickbacks to Venezuelan officials as the hunger crisis worsened, including $8 million to people who work for the current food minister, Gen. Rodolfo Marco Torres. The businessman insisted on speaking anonymously because he did not want to acknowledge participating in corruption. \nLast July, he struggled to get Marco Torres’s attention as a ship full of yellow corn waited to dock. \n“This boat has been waiting for 20 days,” he wrote in text messages seen by AP. \n“What’s the problem?” responded Marco Torres. \nAlthough money was not mentioned, the businessman understood that he needed to give more in kickbacks. In the end, he told the general, the boat had to pull out because costs caused by the delay were mounting. \nBank documents from the businessman’s country show that he was a big supplier, receiving at least $131 million in contracts from Venezuelan food ministers between 2012 and 2015. He explained that vendors like him can afford to pay off military officials because they build huge profit margins into what they bill the state. \nFor example, his $52 million contract for the yellow corn was drawn up to be charged at more than double the market rate at the time, suggesting a potential overpayment of more than $20 million for that deal alone. \nThe Food Ministry’s annual report shows significant overpayments across the board, compared to market prices. And the prices the government pays for imported foods have been increasing in recent years, while global food prices remain stable. \nThis spring, the opposition-controlled congress voted to censure Marco Torres for graft. Maduro vetoed it as an attempt to hurt the Food Ministry, and Marco Torres stayed on as minister. \nInternal budgets from the ministry obtained by AP show the overpayment continues. For example, the government budgeted for $118 million of yellow corn in July at $357 a ton, which would amount to an overpayment of more than $50 million relative to prices that month. \n“What’s amazing about this is it’s like a clean form of corruption,” said Carabobo state lawmaker Neidy Rosal, who has denounced food-related government theft worth hundreds of millions of dollars. “It’s like drug trafficking you can carry out in broad daylight.” \nMarco Torres did not respond to several requests for comment by phone, email and hand-delivered letter. In the past, he has said that he will not be trapped in fights with a bourgeoisie opposition. \n“SCRAPING THE POT” \nBy putting the military in charge of food, Maduro is trying to prevent soldiers from going hungry and being tempted to participate in an uprising against an increasingly unpopular government, said retired Gen. Antonio Rivero. Venezuela’s military has a long history of coups against governments, and Maduro has arrested several officials for allegedly conspiring against him from within. \n“They gave absolute control to the military,” Rivero said from exile in Miami. “That drained the feeling of rebellion from the armed forces, and allowed them to feed their families.” \nHowever, it also opened the door to widespread graft and further squeezed the food supply. In large part due to concerns of corruption following the government’s takeover of the food industry, the three largest global food traders — U.S.-based Archer Daniels Midland Co., Bunge Ltd. and Cargill — have stopped selling to the Venezuelan government. \nOne major scam involves the strict currency controls that have been a hallmark of the administration. The government gives out a limited amount of coveted U.S. currency at a rate of 10 bolivars to the dollar. Almost everyone else has to buy dollars on the ever more expensive black market, currently at 3,000 bolivars to the dollar. \nThe holders of licenses to import food are among the select few who get to buy dollars at the vastly cheaper rate. Alcala, the retired general, said some officials distribute these much-desired licenses to friends. The friends then use only a fraction of the dollars to import food, and share the rest with the officials. \n“We call it ‘scraping the pot,’ and it’s the biggest scam going in Venezuela,” Alcala said. \nIn 2014, one general presented Maduro with a list of 300 companies suspected of simply pocketing the cheap dollars they obtained with their licenses and not importing anything. No action was ever taken and the general was forced into exile, accused of corruption himself. \nSome contracts go to companies that have no experience dealing in food or seem to exist only on paper. Financial documents obtained by AP show that Marco Torres gave Panama-registered company Atlas Systems International a $4.6 million contract to import pasta. Atlas has all the hallmarks of a shell company, including no known assets and the use of secretive shares to hide the identity of the company’s true owners. Another government food supplier, J.A. Comercio de Generos Alimenticios, lists on its website a non-existent address on a narrow, partially paved street in an industrial city near Sao Paulo, Brazil. \nThe two companies transferred more than $5.5 million in U.S. dollars in 2012 and 2013 to a Geneva account controlled by two young Venezuelans, according to bank and internal company documents seen by AP. The Venezuelans were Jesus Marquina Parra and Nestor Marquina Parra, brothers-in-law of the then-food minister, Gen. Carlos Osorio. Efforts to reach the brothers were unsuccessful. \nOsorio is no longer food minister, but has an even more important role in overseeing food. He was promoted in September to inspector general of the armed forces, with the mission of ensuring transparency in the military’s management of the nation’s food supply. \nArturo Sanchez, a former supply chain manager at a multinational dairy company, recounted unpleasant encounters with Osorio. In one case, officers forced the company to buy fructose it didn’t need because they wanted to unload merchandise he suspected was ill-gotten. Another time, he said, national guardsmen took four trucks of goods without paying. Sanchez fled to Florida in 2014. \n“I spent a year living in the U.S. not being able to sleep remembering all the risky situations I lived through,” he said. \nOsorio did not respond to requests for comment. But in the past he threatened to sue opposition lawmakers for staining his honour with false accusations of corruption. He blamed an economic war for the food shortages. \nThe Defence Ministry and presidential press office refused to answer repeated calls, emails and hand-delivered letters requesting comment. In the past, officials have accused the opposition of exaggerating the problem of corruption for political gain. They have said that the military’s hierarchical structure makes it ideally suited to combat the real culprits: Right-wing businessmen trying to bring down the economy. \nFrom time to time, the government carries out raids of warehouses holding smuggled goods and arrests lower-ranking military officers accused of graft. For example, the night market in Carabobo state where Campos bought his corn flour was eventually shut down and 57 tons of smuggled food seized. Now Campos buys staples from intermediaries he suspects are working with the same military officials. \nIn January, the government quietly arrested 40 state employees for stealing large quantities of food from open-air markets. One of those still in jail is a colonel who had been named by Osorio to serve as president of a state agency that imported food. \n“We have the moral fortitude and the discipline to take on this task of protecting what belongs to the people,” the defence minister, Gen. Vladimir Padrino Lopez, said in September. “The state has an obligation to root out corruption in all levels of public administration.” \n“IT’S THE CUSTOMER WHO PAYS” \nAnd yet the corruption persists from the port to the markets, according to dozens of people working in Puerto Cabello, the town that handles the majority of Venezuela’s food imports. \nSometimes the officials who control access to the docks keep ships waiting until they are paid off, said a stevedore at the port, who spoke anonymously because he feared losing his job. \nThe stevedore said clients give him envelopes of dollars to pass on to officials. He described visiting the sergeant in charge and making small talk while placing an envelope in the wastebasket. Then he slides the basket under the table and leaves. That night, his client’s ships are allowed in, he said. \nAfter ships unload their cargo, customs officials take their share, according to four customs workers. They said that without a payment equivalent to a month’s minimum wage, officials will not start the process of nationalizing goods. \nBribes are also required for any missing paperwork, and can exceed $10,000 for a single shipping container, customs worker Aldemar Diaz said. \n“Sometimes you actually want to do it legally, but the officials will say, ‘Don’t bother,'” he said. \nLuis Pena, operations director at the Caracas-based import business Premier Foods, said he pays off a long roster of military officials for each shipment of food he brings in from small-scale companies in the U.S. \n“You have to pay for them to even look at your cargo now,” he said. “It’s an unbroken chain of bribery from when your ship comes in until the food is driven out in trucks.” \nWorst of all, he added, is that he is forced to pay to skip a health inspection. Officials make him buy a health certificate and don’t even open the containers to test a sample, he said. \nA version of this process also takes place on the border, said Alcala, the retired general who was once in charge of border control. He said officers allowed smugglers to pay bribes to bring in food without proper health and safety checks. This year, Venezuelans began posting photos and videos showing magnets pulling tiny iron shavings out of freshly opened bags of sugar smuggled in from Brazil. \nPena said his contacts at the port have offered to illegally sell him government-imported staples like sugar and rice, complete with falsified papers and a military escort. \n“The military was supposed to step in and make sure the food got to the people, but it’s been the exact opposite,” said Pena, sitting in his warehouse. “They’ve made it into a business, and there’s no one to appeal to. In the end, it’s the customer who pays.” \nIf he tries to get through the process without bribes, he said, the food sits and spoils. \nRotting food is a problem even as 90 per cent of Venezuelans say they can’t afford enough to eat. In some cases, partners buy food that is about to expire at a steep discount, then bill the government for the full price. The government has sometimes acknowledged that food it imported arrived already expired. \nThe problem of rotting food got so bad at Puerto Cabello that it drew rebuke in the most recent state comptroller’s report, which expressed particular dismay that thousands of tons of state-imported beans had been allowed to spoil. \nWhen the food is no longer usable, the military tries to get rid of it quietly. Puerto Cabello crane operator Daniel Arteaga watched one night last winter as workers at a state-run warehouse buried hundreds of containers of spoiled chicken and meat imported by the government. \n“All these refrigerated containers, and meanwhile people are waiting in food lines each week just to buy a single chicken,” he said. \nPhotos taken at the Puerto Cabello dump last year show men in green military fatigues helping bury beef and chicken. Residents at a slum down the hill said after the military visits the dump, they dig up animal feed, potatoes, even ham to give their children. \nThe docks are hidden behind high concrete walls, and guards watch every entrance. AP gained rare access in November. The low-ranking military members assigned to guard the port can be seen collaborating with thieves to steal what little food comes in, according to eight people who work behind the walls. \n“You see people making off with whole sacks of flour or corn on their shoulders, and paying the guards on their way out,” logistics co-ordinator Nicole Mendoza said. “You see the money changing hands, and you just lower your eyes and don’t say anything.” \nLt. Miletsy Rodriguez, who is in charge of a group of national guardsmen running security at the port, said people are just looking to scapegoat the military. If her unit wasn’t around, looting would be even more widespread, she said. \n“The majority of us are doing our best. And sooner or later we’ll catch people who are not doing the job right,” she said. \nBRIBES ON THE ROAD \nJust as bribes are needed to get food into the port, they are also required to move food out, truckers said. \nThe roads near the port are lined with trucks waiting to be let in. Drivers sling hammocks in their wheel wells and sometimes wait several days in the thick tropical heat. Trucking bosses recently banded together to stop paying bribes to port officials, and the officials are now punishing them by delaying the movement of cargo onto vehicles, said Jose Petit, president of the Puerto Cabello trucking association. \nWhen the food is finally loaded onto the trucks, soldiers come by to take a cut. Photos and videos taken by truckers show officials taking sacks of sugar and coffee. As the trucks rattle off down the highway, hungry women in clothes that no longer fit chase after them to pick up anything that falls out. \nBillboards lining the highway feature a drawing of an enormous ant beside a nonworking phone number to denounce corruption, and the warning, “No to bachaqueros.” That’s what Venezuelans call people who make a living illegally reselling food, after the leafcutter ants that haul many times their weight through the jungles. \nOn the roads, truck drivers face an obstacle course of military checkpoints, ostensibly set up to stop bachaqueros. Truckers say soldiers at about half the checkpoints demand bribes. Some invent infractions such as an insufficiently filled tire, and take cash along with sacks of pantry items, produce and even live chickens, the drivers said. \n“It used to be you’d go your whole route and not have to pay any anything. Now at every checkpoint, they ask for 10,000 bolivars,” said trucker Henderson Rodriguez, who was waiting for a third day to get into the port to pick up a load of sugar. \nThe surest way to move food through the network of checkpoints is to transport it under military guard. For a percentage of the product’s value, military officers on the take will assign a moonlighting soldier to ride along in the truck, according to five store and restaurant owners. \nSugar and flour are among the items most in demand because they have become virtually impossible to find legally, and some businesses, like bakeries, cannot function without them. A half dozen bakery owners across the country said in interviews that military officials regularly approach them with offers to sell supplies in exchange for a bribe. \nIn the city of Valencia, bakery owner Jose Ferreira cuts two checks for each purchase of sugar: one for the official price of 2 cents a pound and one for the kickback of 60 cents of pound. He keeps copies of both checks in his books, seen by AP, in case the authorities ever come asking. \n“You make the legal payment, and then you pay the kickback,” he said. “We have no other option; there’s no substitute for sugar.” \nThe theft extends to the very end of the food supply chain, vendors said. At one market in Valencia, the military members who were appointed in August to stop contraband confiscated vendors’ produce. They said the vendors did not have the right permits. The food was piled in an olive green cargo truck. \nIn Puerto Cabello, hungry residents said it feels like corrupt soldiers are taking food off their children’s plates. Pedro Contreras, 74, watched more than 100 trucks carrying corn rattle onto the highway, and walked stiffly into traffic to sweep up the kernels that had sifted out. He planned to pound them into corn flour that night to feed his family. \n“The military is getting fat while my grandchildren get skinny,” he said. “All of Venezuela’s food comes through here, but so little of it goes to us.” \n___ \nAssociated Press writers Stan Lehman in Sao Paulo, Brazil, and Gisela Salomon in Miami contributed to this report. \n___ \nEXTRA: AP correspondent Hannah Dreier has been living through chaos this year as Venezuela edges toward collapse.

      "title": "Here's the other iconic N.S. boat to be immortalized on a coin",
      "text": "A type of boat designed in Nova Scotia that's become a ubiquitous sight at East Coast fishing ports over the past century will soon be found in the pockets of Canadians.\nThe new 2017 commemorative loonie, part of a design contest by the Royal Canadian Mint, will feature a Cape Islander boat among other Canadian icons and landmarks.\nFeaturing unmistakable high bows and an open workspace, the boat is believed to have originated in Clark's Harbour around 1905. A write-up on the boat can be found on the town's website as part of its local history section.\n\"Most people now are pretty familiar with the Cape Islander boat,\" said Leigh Stoddart, mayor of Clark's Harbour, a small community on Cape Sable Island off Nova Scotia's southwest coast.\n'Pretty proud' Stoddart said the coin's designer, Wesley Klassen of St. Catharines, Ont., did a good job of capturing the boat's likeness.\n\"It's pretty accurate,\" said Stoddart. \"I felt pretty good, pretty proud, because it's from my hometown.\"\n\nDoing a story about the Cape Islander on the 2017 commemorative loonie. Found this in the CBC archives from 1957, about origin of the boat. pic.twitter.com/Q0Qx9WZspS \n— @shainaluck The coin, which is meant to celebrate Canada's 150th anniversary, also features another Nova Scotia icon: the lighthouse at Peggys Cove.\nThe design also includes Vancouver's Lions Gate Bridge, a prairie grain elevator, the CN Tower, and the Chateau Frontenac in Old Quebec. \nSt. Catharines man's design chosen for Canada 150 loonie \"They're all icons of Canada,\" said Stoddart. \"People immediately recognize Peggys Cove. So to have our boat in with that group of designs, it's quite something for us.\"\nInspired by cross-Canada trip Klassen, 50, said his creation was inspired by childhood memories of a road trip across the country with his family.\n\"Seeing the fishing boats, camping, having our lobsters cooked on the roadside lobster stands with the big black open kettles — that's where I drew upon those ideas,\" he said. \nThe Cape Islander boat features high bows and a large workspace. It's believed to have originated around 1905 in Clark's Harbour, N.S. (www.clarksharbour.com)\nStoddart said he thinks having Clark's Harbour's famous export on the currency will bring greater exposure for the town of about 800.\n\"Where it originated right here in Clark's Harbour, yes, I think it will help us,\" he said. \nNova Scotia's most famous vessel — the Bluenose — has been featured on the Canadian dime since 1937. Every year tourists flock to see a replica of the schooner in its home port of Lunenburg.\nA lasting tradition Cape Islander boats continue to be favourites for fishermen, although they are now made of fibreglass, not wood. \n\"A lot of them are built here in Clark's Harbour,\" said Stoddart. \"Right now we're on a boom. There's a backlog of about three years to get one built, actually.\"\nStoddart said the town will likely order a few of the commemorative loonies to give as gifts. \n\nThe coin is set to enter circulation in the spring.",

(AP Photo/Ariana Cubillos) \nPUERTO CABELLO, Venezuela – When hunger drew tens of thousands of Venezuelans to the streets in protest last summer, President Nicolas Maduro turned to the military to manage the country’s diminished food supply, putting generals in charge of everything from butter to rice. \nBut instead of fighting hunger, the military is making money from it, an Associated Press investigation shows. That’s what grocer Jose Campos found when he ran out of pantry staples this year. In the middle of the night, he would travel to an illegal market run by the military to buy pallets of corn flour — at 100 times the government-set price. \n“The military would be watching over whole bags of money,” Campos said. “They always had what I needed.” \nWith much of the country on the verge of starvation and billions of dollars at stake, food trafficking has become one of the biggest businesses in Venezuela, the AP found. And from generals to foot soldiers, the military is at the heart of the graft, according to documents and interviews with more than 60 officials, business owners and workers, including five former generals. \nAs a result, food is not reaching those who most need it. \nThe U.S. government has taken notice. Prosecutors have opened investigations against senior Venezuelan officials, including members of the military, for laundering riches from food contracts through the U.S. financial system, according to four people with direct knowledge of the probes. No charges have been brought. \n“Lately, food is a better business than drugs,” said retired Gen. Cliver Alcala, who helped oversee Venezuela’s border security. “The military is in charge of food management now, and they’re not going to just take that on without getting their cut.” \n“WHAT’S THE PROBLEM?” \nAfter opposition attempts to overthrow him, the late President Hugo Chavez began handing the military control over the food industry, creating a Food Ministry in 2004. His socialist-run government nationalized farms and food processing plants, then neglected them, and domestic production dried up. Oil-exporting Venezuela became dependent on food imports, but when the price of oil collapsed in 2014, the government no longer could afford all the country needed. \nFood rationing grew so severe that Venezuelans spent all day waiting in lines. Pediatric wards filled up with underweight children, and formerly middle class adults began picking through trash bins for scraps. When people responded with violent street protests, Maduro handed the generals control over the rest of food distribution, and the country’s ports. \nThe government now imports nearly all of Venezuela’s food, according to Werner Gutierrez, the former dean of the agronomy school at the University of Zulia, and corruption is rampant, jacking up prices and leading to shortages. \n“If Venezuela paid market prices, we’d be able to double our imports and easily satisfy the country’s food needs,” Gutierrez said. “Instead, people are starving.” \nOne South American businessman said he paid millions in kickbacks to Venezuelan officials as the hunger crisis worsened, including $8 million to people who work for the current food minister, Gen. Rodolfo Marco Torres. The businessman insisted on speaking anonymously because he did not want to acknowledge participating in corruption. \nLast July, he struggled to get Marco Torres’s attention as a ship full of yellow corn waited to dock. \n“This boat has been waiting for 20 days,” he wrote in text messages seen by AP. \n“What’s the problem?” responded Marco Torres. \nAlthough money was not mentioned, the businessman understood that he needed to give more in kickbacks. In the end, he told the general, the boat had to pull out because costs caused by the delay were mounting. \nBank documents from the businessman’s country show that he was a big supplier, receiving at least $131 million in contracts from Venezuelan food ministers between 2012 and 2015. He explained that vendors like him can afford to pay off military officials because they build huge profit margins into what they bill the state. \nFor example, his $52 million contract for the yellow corn was drawn up to be charged at more than double the market rate at the time, suggesting a potential overpayment of more than $20 million for that deal alone. \nThe Food Ministry’s annual report shows significant overpayments across the board, compared to market prices. And the prices the government pays for imported foods have been increasing in recent years, while global food prices remain stable. \nThis spring, the opposition-controlled congress voted to censure Marco Torres for graft. Maduro vetoed it as an attempt to hurt the Food Ministry, and Marco Torres stayed on as minister. \nInternal budgets from the ministry obtained by AP show the overpayment continues. For example, the government budgeted for $118 million of yellow corn in July at $357 a ton, which would amount to an overpayment of more than $50 million relative to prices that month. \n“What’s amazing about this is it’s like a clean form of corruption,” said Carabobo state lawmaker Neidy Rosal, who has denounced food-related government theft worth hundreds of millions of dollars. “It’s like drug trafficking you can carry out in broad daylight.” \nMarco Torres did not respond to several requests for comment by phone, email and hand-delivered letter. In the past, he has said that he will not be trapped in fights with a bourgeoisie opposition. \n“SCRAPING THE POT” \nBy putting the military in charge of food, Maduro is trying to prevent soldiers from going hungry and being tempted to participate in an uprising against an increasingly unpopular government, said retired Gen. Antonio Rivero. Venezuela’s military has a long history of coups against governments, and Maduro has arrested several officials for allegedly conspiring against him from within. \n“They gave absolute control to the military,” Rivero said from exile in Miami. “That drained the feeling of rebellion from the armed forces, and allowed them to feed their families.” \nHowever, it also opened the door to widespread graft and further squeezed the food supply. In large part due to concerns of corruption following the government’s takeover of the food industry, the three largest global food traders — U.S.-based Archer Daniels Midland Co., Bunge Ltd. and Cargill — have stopped selling to the Venezuelan government. \nOne major scam involves the strict currency controls that have been a hallmark of the administration. The government gives out a limited amount of coveted U.S. currency at a rate of 10 bolivars to the dollar. Almost everyone else has to buy dollars on the ever more expensive black market, currently at 3,000 bolivars to the dollar. \nThe holders of licenses to import food are among the select few who get to buy dollars at the vastly cheaper rate. Alcala, the retired general, said some officials distribute these much-desired licenses to friends. The friends then use only a fraction of the dollars to import food, and share the rest with the officials. \n“We call it ‘scraping the pot,’ and it’s the biggest scam going in Venezuela,” Alcala said. \nIn 2014, one general presented Maduro with a list of 300 companies suspected of simply pocketing the cheap dollars they obtained with their licenses and not importing anything. No action was ever taken and the general was forced into exile, accused of corruption himself. \nSome contracts go to companies that have no experience dealing in food or seem to exist only on paper. Financial documents obtained by AP show that Marco Torres gave Panama-registered company Atlas Systems International a $4.6 million contract to import pasta. Atlas has all the hallmarks of a shell company, including no known assets and the use of secretive shares to hide the identity of the company’s true owners. Another government food supplier, J.A. Comercio de Generos Alimenticios, lists on its website a non-existent address on a narrow, partially paved street in an industrial city near Sao Paulo, Brazil. \nThe two companies transferred more than $5.5 million in U.S. dollars in 2012 and 2013 to a Geneva account controlled by two young Venezuelans, according to bank and internal company documents seen by AP. The Venezuelans were Jesus Marquina Parra and Nestor Marquina Parra, brothers-in-law of the then-food minister, Gen. Carlos Osorio. Efforts to reach the brothers were unsuccessful. \nOsorio is no longer food minister, but has an even more important role in overseeing food. He was promoted in September to inspector general of the armed forces, with the mission of ensuring transparency in the military’s management of the nation’s food supply. \nArturo Sanchez, a former supply chain manager at a multinational dairy company, recounted unpleasant encounters with Osorio. In one case, officers forced the company to buy fructose it didn’t need because they wanted to unload merchandise he suspected was ill-gotten. Another time, he said, national guardsmen took four trucks of goods without paying. Sanchez fled to Florida in 2014. \n“I spent a year living in the U.S. not being able to sleep remembering all the risky situations I lived through,” he said. \nOsorio did not respond to requests for comment. But in the past he threatened to sue opposition lawmakers for staining his honour with false accusations of corruption. He blamed an economic war for the food shortages. \nThe Defence Ministry and presidential press office refused to answer repeated calls, emails and hand-delivered letters requesting comment. In the past, officials have accused the opposition of exaggerating the problem of corruption for political gain. They have said that the military’s hierarchical structure makes it ideally suited to combat the real culprits: Right-wing businessmen trying to bring down the economy. \nFrom time to time, the government carries out raids of warehouses holding smuggled goods and arrests lower-ranking military officers accused of graft. For example, the night market in Carabobo state where Campos bought his corn flour was eventually shut down and 57 tons of smuggled food seized. Now Campos buys staples from intermediaries he suspects are working with the same military officials. \nIn January, the government quietly arrested 40 state employees for stealing large quantities of food from open-air markets. One of those still in jail is a colonel who had been named by Osorio to serve as president of a state agency that imported food. \n“We have the moral fortitude and the discipline to take on this task of protecting what belongs to the people,” the defence minister, Gen. Vladimir Padrino Lopez, said in September. “The state has an obligation to root out corruption in all levels of public administration.” \n“IT’S THE CUSTOMER WHO PAYS” \nAnd yet the corruption persists from the port to the markets, according to dozens of people working in Puerto Cabello, the town that handles the majority of Venezuela’s food imports. \nSometimes the officials who control access to the docks keep ships waiting until they are paid off, said a stevedore at the port, who spoke anonymously because he feared losing his job. \nThe stevedore said clients give him envelopes of dollars to pass on to officials. He described visiting the sergeant in charge and making small talk while placing an envelope in the wastebasket. Then he slides the basket under the table and leaves. That night, his client’s ships are allowed in, he said. \nAfter ships unload their cargo, customs officials take their share, according to four customs workers. They said that without a payment equivalent to a month’s minimum wage, officials will not start the process of nationalizing goods. \nBribes are also required for any missing paperwork, and can exceed $10,000 for a single shipping container, customs worker Aldemar Diaz said. \n“Sometimes you actually want to do it legally, but the officials will say, ‘Don’t bother,'” he said. \nLuis Pena, operations director at the Caracas-based import business Premier Foods, said he pays off a long roster of military officials for each shipment of food he brings in from small-scale companies in the U.S. \n“You have to pay for them to even look at your cargo now,” he said. “It’s an unbroken chain of bribery from when your ship comes in until the food is driven out in trucks.” \nWorst of all, he added, is that he is forced to pay to skip a health inspection. Officials make him buy a health certificate and don’t even open the containers to test a sample, he said. \nA version of this process also takes place on the border, said Alcala, the retired general who was once in charge of border control. He said officers allowed smugglers to pay bribes to bring in food without proper health and safety checks. This year, Venezuelans began posting photos and videos showing magnets pulling tiny iron shavings out of freshly opened bags of sugar smuggled in from Brazil. \nPena said his contacts at the port have offered to illegally sell him government-imported staples like sugar and rice, complete with falsified papers and a military escort. \n“The military was supposed to step in and make sure the food got to the people, but it’s been the exact opposite,” said Pena, sitting in his warehouse. “They’ve made it into a business, and there’s no one to appeal to. In the end, it’s the customer who pays.” \nIf he tries to get through the process without bribes, he said, the food sits and spoils. \nRotting food is a problem even as 90 per cent of Venezuelans say they can’t afford enough to eat. In some cases, partners buy food that is about to expire at a steep discount, then bill the government for the full price. The government has sometimes acknowledged that food it imported arrived already expired. \nThe problem of rotting food got so bad at Puerto Cabello that it drew rebuke in the most recent state comptroller’s report, which expressed particular dismay that thousands of tons of state-imported beans had been allowed to spoil. \nWhen the food is no longer usable, the military tries to get rid of it quietly. Puerto Cabello crane operator Daniel Arteaga watched one night last winter as workers at a state-run warehouse buried hundreds of containers of spoiled chicken and meat imported by the government. \n“All these refrigerated containers, and meanwhile people are waiting in food lines each week just to buy a single chicken,” he said. \nPhotos taken at the Puerto Cabello dump last year show men in green military fatigues helping bury beef and chicken. Residents at a slum down the hill said after the military visits the dump, they dig up animal feed, potatoes, even ham to give their children. \nThe docks are hidden behind high concrete walls, and guards watch every entrance. AP gained rare access in November. The low-ranking military members assigned to guard the port can be seen collaborating with thieves to steal what little food comes in, according to eight people who work behind the walls. \n“You see people making off with whole sacks of flour or corn on their shoulders, and paying the guards on their way out,” logistics co-ordinator Nicole Mendoza said. “You see the money changing hands, and you just lower your eyes and don’t say anything.” \nLt. Miletsy Rodriguez, who is in charge of a group of national guardsmen running security at the port, said people are just looking to scapegoat the military. If her unit wasn’t around, looting would be even more widespread, she said. \n“The majority of us are doing our best. And sooner or later we’ll catch people who are not doing the job right,” she said. \nBRIBES ON THE ROAD \nJust as bribes are needed to get food into the port, they are also required to move food out, truckers said. \nThe roads near the port are lined with trucks waiting to be let in. Drivers sling hammocks in their wheel wells and sometimes wait several days in the thick tropical heat. Trucking bosses recently banded together to stop paying bribes to port officials, and the officials are now punishing them by delaying the movement of cargo onto vehicles, said Jose Petit, president of the Puerto Cabello trucking association. \nWhen the food is finally loaded onto the trucks, soldiers come by to take a cut. Photos and videos taken by truckers show officials taking sacks of sugar and coffee. As the trucks rattle off down the highway, hungry women in clothes that no longer fit chase after them to pick up anything that falls out. \nBillboards lining the highway feature a drawing of an enormous ant beside a nonworking phone number to denounce corruption, and the warning, “No to bachaqueros.” That’s what Venezuelans call people who make a living illegally reselling food, after the leafcutter ants that haul many times their weight through the jungles. \nOn the roads, truck drivers face an obstacle course of military checkpoints, ostensibly set up to stop bachaqueros. Truckers say soldiers at about half the checkpoints demand bribes. Some invent infractions such as an insufficiently filled tire, and take cash along with sacks of pantry items, produce and even live chickens, the drivers said. \n“It used to be you’d go your whole route and not have to pay any anything. Now at every checkpoint, they ask for 10,000 bolivars,” said trucker Henderson Rodriguez, who was waiting for a third day to get into the port to pick up a load of sugar. \nThe surest way to move food through the network of checkpoints is to transport it under military guard. For a percentage of the product’s value, military officers on the take will assign a moonlighting soldier to ride along in the truck, according to five store and restaurant owners. \nSugar and flour are among the items most in demand because they have become virtually impossible to find legally, and some businesses, like bakeries, cannot function without them. A half dozen bakery owners across the country said in interviews that military officials regularly approach them with offers to sell supplies in exchange for a bribe. \nIn the city of Valencia, bakery owner Jose Ferreira cuts two checks for each purchase of sugar: one for the official price of 2 cents a pound and one for the kickback of 60 cents of pound. He keeps copies of both checks in his books, seen by AP, in case the authorities ever come asking. \n“You make the legal payment, and then you pay the kickback,” he said. “We have no other option; there’s no substitute for sugar.” \nThe theft extends to the very end of the food supply chain, vendors said. At one market in Valencia, the military members who were appointed in August to stop contraband confiscated vendors’ produce. They said the vendors did not have the right permits. The food was piled in an olive green cargo truck. \nIn Puerto Cabello, hungry residents said it feels like corrupt soldiers are taking food off their children’s plates. Pedro Contreras, 74, watched more than 100 trucks carrying corn rattle onto the highway, and walked stiffly into traffic to sweep up the kernels that had sifted out. He planned to pound them into corn flour that night to feed his family. \n“The military is getting fat while my grandchildren get skinny,” he said. “All of Venezuela’s food comes through here, but so little of it goes to us.” \n___ \nAssociated Press writers Stan Lehman in Sao Paulo, Brazil, and Gisela Salomon in Miami contributed to this report. \n___ \nEXTRA: AP correspondent Hannah Dreier has been living through chaos this year as Venezuela edges toward collapse.

      "text": "Trouble in EUland \nmyth blinds \nFrench President Francois Hollande on Saturday warned against the risks of rising nationalism in his last New Year address ahead of the election of his successor next spring. \n…”There are periods in history when everything may change dramatically. We’re in one of them,” … \n“How can we imagine our country being curled up behind walls [ yer gonna *build a wall*?!? ], reduced to its internal market [ individual countries can’t trade? ], going back to its national currency and, on top of that, discriminating between its own children according to their origins ?” \nThat’s dedication — granted it’s dedication to the symbols rather than the essence of The Idea that international economic interdependence will prevent any further war. \n“Talking of isolation for a project that, on the contrary, takes part in the flow of history, after Brexit and Donald Trump’s election … is a clear misunderstanding of the world’s evolution and peoples’ deep aspirations,” Le Pen said. [ Marine Le Pen, leader of the anti-immigration and anti-euro National Front, and is set to make it to the second round of the election ] \nhm… \nItaly will seek to deport more migrants who have no right to be in the country and will open new detention centers to hold them before their expulsion, according to a written directive and a ministry source. \n…is the first major policy change made by Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni’s government since it took power in mid-December, and comes on the heels of a record year of boat migrant arrivals. \nIn her New Year’s speech, Chancellor Angela Merkel affirmed that her government will win the fight against terrorism with compassion and denied that her open-door mass migration policy, which directly brought terrorists to Germany, was wrong. … Germany will fight the “hatred” of terrorism with “humanity” and “unity.” \n…Merkel asserted that the terror attacks committed by Islamist migrants in Würzburg, Ansbach, and recently at a Christmas market in Berlin were not attacks on Western civilisation but an attack on ‘refugees’ and Germany’s willkommenskultur (‘welcome culture’) . \nso…. willkommenskultur (‘welcome culture’) is *not* part of Western Culture? hm…",

      "title": "Revelers bid adieu to 2016 | The Kingston Whig-Standard",
      "text": "\nAs 2016 draws to a close, revelers around the world are bidding a weary adieu to a year filled with political surprises, prolonged conflicts and deaths of legendary celebrities. \nHow people are ushering in the new year: \nAUSTRALIA \nSydney sent up a dazzling tribute to 2016’s fallen icons with a New Year’s Eve fireworks display honouring the late singer David Bowie and late actor Gene Wilder, becoming the first major city to bid a bittersweet adieu to a turbulent year. \nThe glittering display over Sydney’s famed harbour and bridge featured Saturn and star-shaped fireworks set to “Space Oddity,” the classic song by Bowie — one of the seemingly endless parade of beloved entertainers who died in 2016. \nWilder was also honoured as the bridge lit up in a rainbow of colours while a song from Wilder’s famed film “Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory” played. \n“This year, sadly, we saw the loss of many music and entertainment legends around the world,” fireworks show co-producer Catherine Flanagan said. “So celebrating their music as part of Sydney New Year’s Eve fireworks displays is an opportunity to reflect on the year that has been and what the future may hold.” \n——— \nLAS VEGAS \nMore than 300,000 visitors are expected to descend on Las Vegas for an extravagant New Year’s Eve celebration. \nNightclubs are pulling out all the stops with performances from DJ Calvin Harris, rappers T-Pain and Kendrick Lamar and artists Drake and Bruno Mars. The city’s celebrity chefs have crafted elaborate prix fixe menus complete with caviar and champagne toasts. \nAn eight-minute fireworks show will kick off at the stroke of midnight, with rockets launching from the tops of half a dozen casinos. \nFederal officials have ranked the celebration just below the Super Bowl and on par with the festivities in Times Square. FBI and Secret Service agents will work alongside local police departments that are putting all hands on deck for the big night. \n——— \nGERMANY \nIn Berlin the mood was more sombre than celebratory. \n“I don’t like the way politics is going,” said Daniel Brandt. “Fears are being fanned and people are so angry with each other.” \nThe tone of public debate in Germany has become shriller over the past two years with the influx of hundreds of thousands of migrants. \nTwo Israeli tourists, on a visit to the German capital, seemed at a loss when asked about their wishes for 2017. “Peace on Earth. Just happiness, really,” said Nathan and Libat, declining to give their last names. \nWalking by the Reichstag, Germany’s Parliament building, Hamed Noori said 2016 had been a good year. “I came to Germany from Afghanistan,” he said. “Life is better here.” \nBirgitta Bergquist, a recent retiree visiting Berlin from Sweden, said she looked forward to spending more time with her three-year-old granddaughter. “And we hope the family stays healthy.” \nNicole Durand-Nusser, originally from France but living in Berlin for almost 50 years, said 2016 had been a difficult year: “Brexit, Trump, Erdogan — it’s all getting worse. \n“I’m a convinced European and I hope Europe doesn’t collapse in 2017,” she said. \nLater, police said they arrested a man who shouted “bomb, bomb, bomb” at Berlin’s massive open-air New Year’s party. \nUsing the hashtag “#nichtlustig”— meaning “not funny”— Berlin police tweeted Saturday that the unnamed man “is now celebrating #Welcome2017 with us.” \n——— \nTURKEY \nNeslihan Dogruol, a restaurant owner in a chic Istanbul neighbourhood, said she hopes for peace in 2017 following a year filled with “unrest and death.” \n“2016 affected everyone badly,” she said, referring to major attacks that hit Turkey in the past year. \nThe restaurant, adorned with snowflakes and tiny decorative lights for the evening, will have fewer people for dinner. “There is a serious gap between 2015 and 2016 in terms of business, people are going out less,” Dogruol said, adding that she expects more people to come for drinks. \nAt a commemoration for the 45 people killed in twin bombings on Dec. 10 in Istanbul, 38-year-old Murat Manoglu hoped for a better year ahead. “We lived through terrible days, we have lost many martyrs, many households suffered,” he said. \nSecurity measures were heightened in major Turkish cities. Traffic leading up to key squares in Istanbul and the capital, Ankara, will be closed, police said. In Istanbul, 17,000 police officers were on duty, some camouflaged as Santa Claus and others as street vendors, Turkey’s state-run Anadolu news agency reported on Friday. \nAnkara and Istanbul were targeted by bomb attacks in 2016, killing more than 180 people. Turkey has been in the throes of violence, combating the Islamic State group, Kurdish militants and a coup attempt blamed on the U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen. \n——— \nRUSSIA \nPresident Vladimir Putin invoked a bit of seasonal enchantment in his New Year’s Eve remarks to the nation. \n“Each of us may become something of a magician on the night of the New Year,” Putin said in a short televised address broadcast in the closing minutes of 2016 in each of Russia’s 11 time zones. \n“To do this we simply need to treat our parents with love and gratitude, take care of our children and families, respect our colleagues at work, nurture our friendships, defend truth and justice, be merciful and help those who are in need of support. This is the whole secret,” he said. \nNew Year’s Eve is Russia’s major gift-giving holiday, and big Russian cities were awash in festive lights and decorations. The Moscow subway offered a special holiday train, festooned with lights and artificial greenery. \n“I wish for the next year to better than this,” said rider Alexander Pisaryev. \n“We are waiting for good, for peace and order,” said another, Valentina Daineka. \n——— \nPARIS \nTourists and French revelers swarmed along Paris’ illuminated Champs Elysees Avenue on a frosty night, admiring the laser display from the Arc de Triomphe and lines of trees sparkling with lights. \n“It’s so magical to be here in Paris, on what people say is the world’s most beautiful avenue,” said Maureen O’Reilly, 42, a visitor from Belfast, Northern Ireland. \n“At times like this, I do think about all those terrible things in Aleppo and how lucky we are here in Europe despite everything,” she added. \nSome were happy to say goodbye to 2016. \n“It’s been such a horrible year, with all these (entertainment celebrity) deaths, Syria, Brexit and Trump. I say: good riddance,” said Karine Dublot, 38, from Lyon. \nOthers found a bright side. \n“My hope for 2017 is that we solve all the problems with the migrants here in France, and see the end of (President) Francois Hollande,” said Marc Valli, 35, from Paris. “We need someone who can sort out immigration as president.” \nHollande, who is not standing for re-election in the upcoming ballot, used his last New Year’s address to praise his country’s resilience in the face of deadly attacks in Nice and Saint-Etienne-du-Rouvray. \nHollande said French people could be proud for continuing “to live, work, go out, move around and cherish ... freedom.” \nPolice were out in force — with over 10,000 deployed in the French capital alone — and authorities said that “the passage to the New Year will take place in the context of a persistent and very high terrorist threat.” \n——— \nTHE VATICAN \nPope Francis has called on the faithful to help young people find a place in society, noting the paradox of “a culture that idolizes youth” and yet has made no place for the young. \nFrancis said during vespers marking New Year’s Eve that young people have been “pushed to the margins of public life, forcing them to migrate or to beg for jobs that no longer exist, or fail to promise them a future.” \nMore than responsibility, the pope said the world owed young people a debt, saying it has deprived them of “dignified and genuine work” that would allow them to take part in society, instead condemning them “to knock on doors that for the most part remain closed.” \n——— \nJAPAN \nTemple bells echoed at midnight as families gather around noodles and revelers flock to shrines for the biggest holiday in Japan. \n“I feel this sense of duality,” said Kami Miyamoto, 21, an economics student at Meiji University in Tokyo, who travelled home in Hakusan, Ishikawa prefecture, for the holiday. \n“The world is heading toward conservative insular policies,” she said of the U.S. election, Brexit and what she believes lies ahead for elections in Europe in 2017. “We learned about how valuable it is to get correct information.” \nOne of the most memorable experiences for Miyamoto in 2016 was a three-week study program in South Korea. She was surprised and moved by the friendship she formed with South Korean students, and she has decided to focus her studies on relations with South Korea. \n“Studying about the U.S. and Europe seems to be about looking at the past, but East Asian studies are focusing on the future,” she said. \nMiyamoto’s mother is preparing soba noodles, a standard New Year’s Eve dish in Japan, except in their home it will be filled with green onions and shrimp. As the new year rolls in, the entire family, including her younger brother and sister, will drive to a nearby shrine, which, like temples all over Japan, will be filled with those praying for good fortune in the Year of the Rooster, according to the Chinese zodiac. \n——— \nCHINA \nResidents in Beijing and Shanghai, China’s two largest cities, were passing New Year’s Eve quietly in a relative state of security lockdown, according to Chinese media reports citing police. \nThe Bund waterfront in Shanghai had no celebrations, authorities announced this week, while the sale, use and transportation of fireworks in central Shanghai will be prohibited altogether. Large buildings that often display light shows also stayed dark. More than 30 people died two years ago in a deadly stampede on Shanghai’s waterfront, where 300,000 people had gathered to watch a planned light show. \nBeijing police also said countdowns, light shows, lotteries and other organized activities will not be held in popular shopping districts such as Sanlitun and Guomao. Beijing police advised citizens to avoid crowded areas, closely watch elderly relatives and children, and be aware of exit routes in venues. \nChinese President Xi Jinping said in his annual New Year’s Eve address that his government will continue to focus on alleviating poverty at home and resolutely defending China’s territorial rights. \n——— \nSOUTH KOREA \nHundreds of thousands of South Koreans ushered in the new year with a massive protest demanding the resignation of disgraced President Park Geun-hye. It was the 10th straight weekend of protests that led to Park’s impeachment on Dec. 9 over a corruption scandal. \nThe evening rally was planned to overlap with Seoul’s traditional bell-tolling ceremony at the Bosinkgak pavilion at midnight, which was also expected to be a political statement against Park. \nThe city’s mayor, Park Won-soon, invited as guests a man whose teenage son was among more than 300 people who died during a 2014 ferry sinking, and a woman who was forced into sexual slavery by Japan’s Second World War military. \nPark Geun-hye came under heavy criticism over the way her government handled the ferry disaster. \n“So many unbelievable things happened in 2016. It didn’t feel real; if felt like a movie,” protester Lee Huymi said about the bizarre scandal that brought Park down. “So I hope 2017 brings a movie-like ending to the mess.” \n——— \nINDIA \nFor most people in India, New Year’s Eve is a time for family. In New Delhi and many other cities, newspapers are full of big advertisements for lavish parties at upscale hotels and restaurants. The big draws at the hotel parties are song and dance performances from Bollywood and television stars. \nThe western city of Mumbai will host big street parties with thousands of people at the iconic Gateway of India, a colonial-era structure on the waterfront overlooking the Arabian Sea. And there was talk about money — India’s recent devaluing of its currency in an apparent effort to cut graft and tax evasion. \n“2016 was boring but Modi brought about a twister near the end,” 18-year-old student Jugal Jadhwani said of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s announcement in early November. \n“It’s good for India,” he said. \nIt was a sentiment echoed by 42-year old Prasoon Verma. \n“2016 was good and with demonetization 2017 should be good for the Indian economy and India should move to the digital age,” he said. \n——— \nPHILIPPINES \nThe Philippines’ notorious tradition of dangerous New Year’s Eve celebrations persisted after President Rodrigo Duterte delayed to next year his ban on the use of powerful firecrackers, often worsened by celebratory gunfire. \nPowerful firecrackers and gunfire have maimed hundreds of people and killed some each year across the Philippines despite government crackdowns, an annual government scare campaign and efforts by officials to set up centralized fireworks displays, like on Saturday night. \nDuterte’s southern Davao City hasn’t been tainted by the bloody record because of a largely successful firecrackers ban he enforced when he was still the city’s crime-busting mayor. Last month, he said he would delay his plan to replicate his Davao ban nationwide by a year because many have already invested in firecrackers and he was concerned by the impact of an abrupt ban on poor Filipinos employed in the industry. \nBefore New Year’s Eve, the Department of Health said Saturday that 139 people had been injured by firecracker blasts in recent days, mostly children under 15. \n——— \nROMANIA \nNew Year’s is the biggest party of the year in Romania, and thousands flocked to the mountains to ski, hike and celebrate, some in the mood for fun, others anxious about global challenges in 2017. \nFormer Finance Minister Daniel Daianu, travelling to the mountain town of Sinaia, told The Associated Press that Western governments should pay closer attention to the public mood. \n“People are frustrated, people are resentful and people react,” he said. “Unless governments pay attention to fairness and fair play, we could see some very unpleasant surprises.” \nEarly Saturday, young Romanians roamed streets and trains, wearing peasant costumes and singing traditional songs about goats — a New Year symbol — while waving wands made of dried flowers. \nOne tradition was squelched this year. Police banned masked revelers in the northeastern village of Ruginoasa from staging a traditional fight between young men involving whips and bats after several people were injured a few years ago. \n——— \nUNITED ARAB EMIRATES \nIn Dubai, hundreds of thousands of people watched fireworks shoot from the sides of the world’s tallest building, the 828-metre (2,716-foot) Burj Khalifa. The show was also streamed live online. \nThere was no repeat of last year’s excitement, when police say faulty wiring sparked a fire several hours before midnight at The Address Downtown, a 63-storey skyscraper nearby. The high-rise tower still remains under repair. \nJust before the fireworks, private security guards stood every 50 metres (55 yards) as metal barriers blocked off sidewalks to keep the streets around the Burj Khalifa clear for roaming emergency vehicles, their strobe lights flashing in the darkness. \nWhile 2016 brought challenges across the world, those gathered to watch the fireworks in Dubai instead chose to focus on the positive. \nFor Ina Dumdum, 33, of Manila, Philippines, 2016 brought a new job in Abu Dhabi and greater economic security. Wearing a pink pair of do-it-yourself “Happy New Year” rabbit ears on her head, she smiled while saying she hoped for a baby in the New Year. “2016 was prosperity,” she said. \nTony Ngalande, 38, of Lilongwe, Malawi, also saw success in his automobile importing business. However, “2016 was full of a lot of surprises,” he said, mentioning the election of Donald Trump in the U.S. and the British vote to leave the European Union. \nNgalande laughed when asked if those surprises could portend anything negative for the new year. “So far so good,” he said with a smile.

      "text": "Print \nPresident Hassan Rouhani sought to reassure Iranians on Sunday that the government would work to protect market stability after the country’s currency fell to a record low last week. \n“I am optimistic about the country’s economic situation and ... I want to reassure our people that foreign currencies will not keep going up,” Rouhani said in a live interview with state television. \nIran’s rial hit a record low against the U.S. dollar last Monday in a sign of concern about the country’s ability to attract foreign money after U.S. President-elect Donald Trump takes office on Jan. 20. \nIf the rial’s weakness continues, it could become a political issue ahead of Iran’s presidential election in May by threatening some of Rouhani’s economic achievements. Rouhani, who took office in 2013, is expected to seek re-election but has not announced it officially Economists have said Trump’s election in November was a major factor in the rial’s weakness. He has said he will scrap the deal between Iran and world powers that imposed curbs on Tehran’s nuclear projects and lifted sanctions on the Iranian economy last January. \n“The dollar has gained against all currencies in the past few months and it is natural if it also gains in Iran. But the rate of exchange of foreign currencies will certainly not remain at current levels,” Rouhani said, without giving details of how the government plans to defend the rial. \n“The stability of (currency) markets is important for the government. The economy has to be predictable so that exporters and importers can act with trust,” he said. \nBefore Rouhani’s remarks, the rial strengthened to about 39,000 to the dollar on the free market on Sunday, after sliding to an all-time low of 41,500 last Monday. \nThe rial’s gains came after central bank Governor Valiollah Seif told state television on Saturday that he saw 36,000 rials per dollar as a “realistic” rate. \nSeif was quoted as telling lawmakers that the central bank was injecting $5.8-billion in the market to defend the rial. \nThe currency traded at 35,570 in mid-September. Before December, the record low was about 40,000, hit in late 2012, traders said. \nRouhani’s administration stabilized the currency after years of volatility, which helped bring inflation down to single-digit rates from above 40 per cent. \nBesides the free market exchange rate, Iran uses an official rate, now at 32,375, for some state transactions. \nReuters",

      "text": "A type of boat designed in Nova Scotia that's become a ubiquitous sight at East Coast fishing ports over the past century will soon be found in the pockets of Canadians.\nThe new 2017 commemorative loonie, part of a design contest by the Royal Canadian Mint, will feature a Cape Islander boat among other Canadian icons and landmarks.\nFeaturing unmistakable high bows and an open workspace, the boat is believed to have originated in Clark's Harbour around 1905. A write-up on the boat can be found on the town's website as part of its local history section.\n\"Most people now are pretty familiar with the Cape Islander boat,\" said Leigh Stoddart, mayor of Clark's Harbour, a small community on Cape Sable Island off Nova Scotia's southwest coast.\n'Pretty proud' Stoddart said the coin's designer, Wesley Klassen of St. Catharines, Ont., did a good job of capturing the boat's likeness.\n\"It's pretty accurate,\" said Stoddart. \"I felt pretty good, pretty proud, because it's from my hometown.\"\nDoing a story about the Cape Islander on the 2017 commemorative loonie. Found this in the CBC archives from 1957, about origin of the boat. pic.twitter.com/Q0Qx9WZspS\n— @shainaluck The coin, which is meant to celebrate Canada's 150th anniversary, also features another Nova Scotia icon: the lighthouse at Peggys Cove.\nThe design also includes Vancouver's Lions Gate Bridge, a prairie grain elevator, the CN Tower, and the Chateau Frontenac in Old Quebec.\nSt. Catharines man's design chosen for Canada 150 loonie \"They're all icons of Canada,\" said Stoddart. \"People immediately recognize Peggys Cove. So to have our boat in with that group of designs, it's quite something for us.\"\nInspired by cross-Canada trip Klassen, 50, said his creation was inspired by childhood memories of a road trip across the country with his family.\n\"Seeing the fishing boats, camping, having our lobsters cooked on the roadside lobster stands with the big black open kettles — that's where I drew upon those ideas,\" he said.\nThe Cape Islander boat features high bows and a large workspace. It's believed to have originated around 1905 in Clark's Harbour, N.S. (www.clarksharbour.com)\nStoddart said he thinks having Clark's Harbour's famous export on the currency will bring greater exposure for the town of about 800.\n\"Where it originated right here in Clark's Harbour, yes, I think it will help us,\" he said.\nNova Scotia's most famous vessel — the Bluenose — has been featured on the Canadian dime since 1937. Every year tourists flock to see a replica of the schooner in its home port of Lunenburg.\nA lasting tradition Cape Islander boats continue to be favourites for fishermen, although they are now made of fibreglass, not wood.\n\"A lot of them are built here in Clark's Harbour,\" said Stoddart. \"Right now we're on a boom. There's a backlog of about three years to get one built, actually.\"\nStoddart said the town will likely order a few of the commemorative loonies to give as gifts.\nThe coin is set to enter circulation in the spring.",

      "title": "Venezuela military trafficking food as country goes hungry",
      "text": "by Hannah Dreier And Joshua Goodman, The Associated Press Posted Jan 1, 2017 1:09   1:40 pm AST \nPUERTO CABELLO, Venezuela – When hunger drew tens of thousands of Venezuelans to the streets in protest last summer, President Nicolas Maduro turned to the military to manage the country’s diminished food supply, putting generals in charge of everything from butter to rice. \nBut instead of fighting hunger, the military is making money from it, an Associated Press investigation shows. That’s what grocer Jose Campos found when he ran out of pantry staples this year. In the middle of the night, he would travel to an illegal market run by the military to buy pallets of corn flour — at 100 times the government-set price. \n“The military would be watching over whole bags of money,” Campos said. “They always had what I needed.” \nWith much of the country on the verge of starvation and billions of dollars at stake, food trafficking has become one of the biggest businesses in Venezuela, the AP found. And from generals to foot soldiers, the military is at the heart of the graft, according to documents and interviews with more than 60 officials, business owners and workers, including five former generals. \nAs a result, food is not reaching those who most need it. \nThe U.S. government has taken notice. Prosecutors have opened investigations against senior Venezuelan officials, including members of the military, for laundering riches from food contracts through the U.S. financial system, according to four people with direct knowledge of the probes. No charges have been brought. \n“Lately, food is a better business than drugs,” said retired Gen. Cliver Alcala, who helped oversee Venezuela’s border security. “The military is in charge of food management now, and they’re not going to just take that on without getting their cut.” \n“WHAT’S THE PROBLEM?” \nAfter opposition attempts to overthrow him, the late President Hugo Chavez began handing the military control over the food industry, creating a Food Ministry in 2004. His socialist-run government nationalized farms and food processing plants, then neglected them, and domestic production dried up. Oil-exporting Venezuela became dependent on food imports, but when the price of oil collapsed in 2014, the government no longer could afford all the country needed. \nFood rationing grew so severe that Venezuelans spent all day waiting in lines. Pediatric wards filled up with underweight children, and formerly middle class adults began picking through trash bins for scraps. When people responded with violent street protests, Maduro handed the generals control over the rest of food distribution, and the country’s ports. \nThe government now imports nearly all of Venezuela’s food, according to Werner Gutierrez, the former dean of the agronomy school at the University of Zulia, and corruption is rampant, jacking up prices and leading to shortages. \n“If Venezuela paid market prices, we’d be able to double our imports and easily satisfy the country’s food needs,” Gutierrez said. “Instead, people are starving.” \nOne South American businessman said he paid millions in kickbacks to Venezuelan officials as the hunger crisis worsened, including $8 million to people who work for the current food minister, Gen. Rodolfo Marco Torres. The businessman insisted on speaking anonymously because he did not want to acknowledge participating in corruption. \nLast July, he struggled to get Marco Torres’s attention as a ship full of yellow corn waited to dock. \n“This boat has been waiting for 20 days,” he wrote in text messages seen by AP. \n“What’s the problem?” responded Marco Torres. \nAlthough money was not mentioned, the businessman understood that he needed to give more in kickbacks. In the end, he told the general, the boat had to pull out because costs caused by the delay were mounting. \nBank documents from the businessman’s country show that he was a big supplier, receiving at least $131 million in contracts from Venezuelan food ministers between 2012 and 2015. He explained that vendors like him can afford to pay off military officials because they build huge profit margins into what they bill the state. \nFor example, his $52 million contract for the yellow corn was drawn up to be charged at more than double the market rate at the time, suggesting a potential overpayment of more than $20 million for that deal alone. \nThe Food Ministry’s annual report shows significant overpayments across the board, compared to market prices. And the prices the government pays for imported foods have been increasing in recent years, while global food prices remain stable. \nThis spring, the opposition-controlled congress voted to censure Marco Torres for graft. Maduro vetoed it as an attempt to hurt the Food Ministry, and Marco Torres stayed on as minister. \nInternal budgets from the ministry obtained by AP show the overpayment continues. For example, the government budgeted for $118 million of yellow corn in July at $357 a ton, which would amount to an overpayment of more than $50 million relative to prices that month. \n“What’s amazing about this is it’s like a clean form of corruption,” said Carabobo state lawmaker Neidy Rosal, who has denounced food-related government theft worth hundreds of millions of dollars. “It’s like drug trafficking you can carry out in broad daylight.” \nMarco Torres did not respond to several requests for comment by phone, email and hand-delivered letter. In the past, he has said that he will not be trapped in fights with a bourgeoisie opposition. \n“SCRAPING THE POT” \nBy putting the military in charge of food, Maduro is trying to prevent soldiers from going hungry and being tempted to participate in an uprising against an increasingly unpopular government, said retired Gen. Antonio Rivero. Venezuela’s military has a long history of coups against governments, and Maduro has arrested several officials for allegedly conspiring against him from within. \n“They gave absolute control to the military,” Rivero said from exile in Miami. “That drained the feeling of rebellion from the armed forces, and allowed them to feed their families.” \nHowever, it also opened the door to widespread graft and further squeezed the food supply. In large part due to concerns of corruption following the government’s takeover of the food industry, the three largest global food traders — U.S.-based Archer Daniels Midland Co., Bunge Ltd. and Cargill — have stopped selling to the Venezuelan government. \nOne major scam involves the strict currency controls that have been a hallmark of the administration. The government gives out a limited amount of coveted U.S. currency at a rate of 10 bolivars to the dollar. Almost everyone else has to buy dollars on the ever more expensive black market, currently at 3,000 bolivars to the dollar. \nThe holders of licenses to import food are among the select few who get to buy dollars at the vastly cheaper rate. Alcala, the retired general, said some officials distribute these much-desired licenses to friends. The friends then use only a fraction of the dollars to import food, and share the rest with the officials. \n“We call it ‘scraping the pot,’ and it’s the biggest scam going in Venezuela,” Alcala said. \nIn 2014, one general presented Maduro with a list of 300 companies suspected of simply pocketing the cheap dollars they obtained with their licenses and not importing anything. No action was ever taken and the general was forced into exile, accused of corruption himself. \nSome contracts go to companies that have no experience dealing in food or seem to exist only on paper. Financial documents obtained by AP show that Marco Torres gave Panama-registered company Atlas Systems International a $4.6 million contract to import pasta. Atlas has all the hallmarks of a shell company, including no known assets and the use of secretive shares to hide the identity of the company’s true owners. Another government food supplier, J.A. Comercio de Generos Alimenticios, lists on its website a non-existent address on a narrow, partially paved street in an industrial city near Sao Paulo, Brazil. \nThe two companies transferred more than $5.5 million in U.S. dollars in 2012 and 2013 to a Geneva account controlled by two young Venezuelans, according to bank and internal company documents seen by AP. The Venezuelans were Jesus Marquina Parra and Nestor Marquina Parra, brothers-in-law of the then-food minister, Gen. Carlos Osorio. Efforts to reach the brothers were unsuccessful. \nOsorio is no longer food minister, but has an even more important role in overseeing food. He was promoted in September to inspector general of the armed forces, with the mission of ensuring transparency in the military’s management of the nation’s food supply. \nArturo Sanchez, a former supply chain manager at a multinational dairy company, recounted unpleasant encounters with Osorio. In one case, officers forced the company to buy fructose it didn’t need because they wanted to unload merchandise he suspected was ill-gotten. Another time, he said, national guardsmen took four trucks of goods without paying. Sanchez fled to Florida in 2014. \n“I spent a year living in the U.S. not being able to sleep remembering all the risky situations I lived through,” he said. \nOsorio did not respond to requests for comment. But in the past he threatened to sue opposition lawmakers for staining his honour with false accusations of corruption. He blamed an economic war for the food shortages. \nThe Defence Ministry and presidential press office refused to answer repeated calls, emails and hand-delivered letters requesting comment. In the past, officials have accused the opposition of exaggerating the problem of corruption for political gain. They have said that the military’s hierarchical structure makes it ideally suited to combat the real culprits: Right-wing businessmen trying to bring down the economy. \nFrom time to time, the government carries out raids of warehouses holding smuggled goods and arrests lower-ranking military officers accused of graft. For example, the night market in Carabobo state where Campos bought his corn flour was eventually shut down and 57 tons of smuggled food seized. Now Campos buys staples from intermediaries he suspects are working with the same military officials. \nIn January, the government quietly arrested 40 state employees for stealing large quantities of food from open-air markets. One of those still in jail is a colonel who had been named by Osorio to serve as president of a state agency that imported food. \n“We have the moral fortitude and the discipline to take on this task of protecting what belongs to the people,” the defence minister, Gen. Vladimir Padrino Lopez, said in September. “The state has an obligation to root out corruption in all levels of public administration.” \n“IT’S THE CUSTOMER WHO PAYS” \nAnd yet the corruption persists from the port to the markets, according to dozens of people working in Puerto Cabello, the town that handles the majority of Venezuela’s food imports. \nSometimes the officials who control access to the docks keep ships waiting until they are paid off, said a stevedore at the port, who spoke anonymously because he feared losing his job. \nThe stevedore said clients give him envelopes of dollars to pass on to officials. He described visiting the sergeant in charge and making small talk while placing an envelope in the wastebasket. Then he slides the basket under the table and leaves. That night, his client’s ships are allowed in, he said. \nAfter ships unload their cargo, customs officials take their share, according to four customs workers. They said that without a payment equivalent to a month’s minimum wage, officials will not start the process of nationalizing goods. \nBribes are also required for any missing paperwork, and can exceed $10,000 for a single shipping container, customs worker Aldemar Diaz said. \n“Sometimes you actually want to do it legally, but the officials will say, ‘Don’t bother,'” he said. \nLuis Pena, operations director at the Caracas-based import business Premier Foods, said he pays off a long roster of military officials for each shipment of food he brings in from small-scale companies in the U.S. \n“You have to pay for them to even look at your cargo now,” he said. “It’s an unbroken chain of bribery from when your ship comes in until the food is driven out in trucks.” \nWorst of all, he added, is that he is forced to pay to skip a health inspection. Officials make him buy a health certificate and don’t even open the containers to test a sample, he said. \nA version of this process also takes place on the border, said Alcala, the retired general who was once in charge of border control. He said officers allowed smugglers to pay bribes to bring in food without proper health and safety checks. This year, Venezuelans began posting photos and videos showing magnets pulling tiny iron shavings out of freshly opened bags of sugar smuggled in from Brazil. \nPena said his contacts at the port have offered to illegally sell him government-imported staples like sugar and rice, complete with falsified papers and a military escort. \n“The military was supposed to step in and make sure the food got to the people, but it’s been the exact opposite,” said Pena, sitting in his warehouse. “They’ve made it into a business, and there’s no one to appeal to. In the end, it’s the customer who pays.” \nIf he tries to get through the process without bribes, he said, the food sits and spoils. \nRotting food is a problem even as 90 per cent of Venezuelans say they can’t afford enough to eat. In some cases, partners buy food that is about to expire at a steep discount, then bill the government for the full price. The government has sometimes acknowledged that food it imported arrived already expired. \nThe problem of rotting food got so bad at Puerto Cabello that it drew rebuke in the most recent state comptroller’s report, which expressed particular dismay that thousands of tons of state-imported beans had been allowed to spoil. \nWhen the food is no longer usable, the military tries to get rid of it quietly. Puerto Cabello crane operator Daniel Arteaga watched one night last winter as workers at a state-run warehouse buried hundreds of containers of spoiled chicken and meat imported by the government. \n“All these refrigerated containers, and meanwhile people are waiting in food lines each week just to buy a single chicken,” he said. \nPhotos taken at the Puerto Cabello dump last year show men in green military fatigues helping bury beef and chicken. Residents at a slum down the hill said after the military visits the dump, they dig up animal feed, potatoes, even ham to give their children. \nThe docks are hidden behind high concrete walls, and guards watch every entrance. AP gained rare access in November. The low-ranking military members assigned to guard the port can be seen collaborating with thieves to steal what little food comes in, according to eight people who work behind the walls. \n“You see people making off with whole sacks of flour or corn on their shoulders, and paying the guards on their way out,” logistics co-ordinator Nicole Mendoza said. “You see the money changing hands, and you just lower your eyes and don’t say anything.” \nLt. Miletsy Rodriguez, who is in charge of a group of national guardsmen running security at the port, said people are just looking to scapegoat the military. If her unit wasn’t around, looting would be even more widespread, she said. \n“The majority of us are doing our best. And sooner or later we’ll catch people who are not doing the job right,” she said. \nBRIBES ON THE ROAD \nJust as bribes are needed to get food into the port, they are also required to move food out, truckers said. \nThe roads near the port are lined with trucks waiting to be let in. Drivers sling hammocks in their wheel wells and sometimes wait several days in the thick tropical heat. Trucking bosses recently banded together to stop paying bribes to port officials, and the officials are now punishing them by delaying the movement of cargo onto vehicles, said Jose Petit, president of the Puerto Cabello trucking association. \nWhen the food is finally loaded onto the trucks, soldiers come by to take a cut. Photos and videos taken by truckers show officials taking sacks of sugar and coffee. As the trucks rattle off down the highway, hungry women in clothes that no longer fit chase after them to pick up anything that falls out. \nBillboards lining the highway feature a drawing of an enormous ant beside a nonworking phone number to denounce corruption, and the warning, “No to bachaqueros.” That’s what Venezuelans call people who make a living illegally reselling food, after the leafcutter ants that haul many times their weight through the jungles. \nOn the roads, truck drivers face an obstacle course of military checkpoints, ostensibly set up to stop bachaqueros. Truckers say soldiers at about half the checkpoints demand bribes. Some invent infractions such as an insufficiently filled tire, and take cash along with sacks of pantry items, produce and even live chickens, the drivers said. \n“It used to be you’d go your whole route and not have to pay any anything. Now at every checkpoint, they ask for 10,000 bolivars,” said trucker Henderson Rodriguez, who was waiting for a third day to get into the port to pick up a load of sugar. \nThe surest way to move food through the network of checkpoints is to transport it under military guard. For a percentage of the product’s value, military officers on the take will assign a moonlighting soldier to ride along in the truck, according to five store and restaurant owners. \nSugar and flour are among the items most in demand because they have become virtually impossible to find legally, and some businesses, like bakeries, cannot function without them. A half dozen bakery owners across the country said in interviews that military officials regularly approach them with offers to sell supplies in exchange for a bribe. \nIn the city of Valencia, bakery owner Jose Ferreira cuts two checks for each purchase of sugar: one for the official price of 2 cents a pound and one for the kickback of 60 cents of pound. He keeps copies of both checks in his books, seen by AP, in case the authorities ever come asking. \n“You make the legal payment, and then you pay the kickback,” he said. “We have no other option; there’s no substitute for sugar.” \nThe theft extends to the very end of the food supply chain, vendors said. At one market in Valencia, the military members who were appointed in August to stop contraband confiscated vendors’ produce. They said the vendors did not have the right permits. The food was piled in an olive green cargo truck. \nIn Puerto Cabello, hungry residents said it feels like corrupt soldiers are taking food off their children’s plates. Pedro Contreras, 74, watched more than 100 trucks carrying corn rattle onto the highway, and walked stiffly into traffic to sweep up the kernels that had sifted out. He planned to pound them into corn flour that night to feed his family. \n“The military is getting fat while my grandchildren get skinny,” he said. “All of Venezuela’s food comes through here, but so little of it goes to us.” \n___ \nAssociated Press writers Stan Lehman in Sao Paulo, Brazil, and Gisela Salomon in Miami contributed to this report. \n___ \nEXTRA: AP correspondent Hannah Dreier has been living through chaos this year as Venezuela edges toward collapse.

      "text": "By Dave Maass \nWhile the presidential election has thrown the federal government into a cloud of uncertainty, one thing is clear: EFF has never been in a better position to protect our rights on the state level in California. In 2016, we built off our previous victories around surveillance transparency, passed new laws reforming criminal justice, defeated other bills that would’ve weakened our liberties, and laid the groundwork for the hard fight ahead in 2017. \nHere’s a round-up of some of our efforts in Sacramento over the last year. Crowdsourcing Transparency \nIn 2015, EFF supported a series of bills to require government agencies to disclose their policies for use of automated license plate readers (ALPR) and cell-site simulators, and to publish inventories of all the systems they use to store data on the public. The three bills went into effect this year, and EFF’s supporters were ready to hold the agencies to account. \nIn April, more than 30 citizen watchdogs joined EFF for the “California Surveillance Sweep,” in which we combed through local government agency websites for policies related to ALPR and cell-tracking technology. We found nearly 80 policies , but also identified another 90 that were not in compliance with the new laws. In the months since, many of those agencies have responded to our report by publishing those policies online . \nIn August, our team of transparency advocates reassembled for the “California Database Hunt,” in which we scoured government websites for inventories of “enterprise systems,” the software systems agencies use to store information. These inventories are supposed to disclose the types of information agencies collect on the public and the purposes for amassing the information. In all, we compiled more 400 catalogs from across the state. Later EFF presented our findings at a state senate committee. Watch the video here . \nNext year, the legislature will consider a bill to expand these requirements to cover a larger array of surveillance technologies, and we look forward to working with the sponsor, Sen. Jerry Hill, on promoting these transparency efforts. Gang Database Reform \nA deep investigation by Reveal , followed by a California State Auditor’s report , found massive problems with CalGang, the state’s law enforcement database that contains information on suspected gang members and their associates. The database was found to be rife with errors, lacking accountability, and providing little crime-fighting value. \nEFF joined a coalition of justice organizations to flood legislators and the governor with emails in support A.B. 2298 , a bill that would partially reform CalGang.The bill was signed by Gov. Jerry Brown in September, requiring law enforcement to inform people before they’re added to a shared gang database. Under the new law, people have a chance to go to court to challenge their inclusion in a gang database. And by January 2018, agencies that maintain these databases will have to produce detailed transparency reports. No SmartPhone Backdoors \nAmid the battle between Apple and the FBI over access to an encrypted iPhone used by a suspect in the San Bernadino shooting, Assemblymember Jim Cooper introduced a bill to require phone manufacturers to decrypt phones or else pay a fine. EFF launched a campaign to defeat the bill and emerged victorious : the legislation never made it out of its first committee. Keeping Public Records in the Public Domain \nFollowing a brouhaha over who owns the name to a resort in Yosemite, the state legislature introduced a bill that would allow government agencies to claim intellectual property rights over government-produced works, overturning the current status quo that puts most public records in the public domain. The bill could have limited the right of the public and the press to publish records they received through the California Public Records Act. EFF, and a coalition of 25 organizations, fought hard against the legislation, resulting in the author abandoning the bill . Defending Drone Enthusiasts \nSeveral lawmakers in California introduced bills designed to regulate the consumer drone industry. While the lawmakers may have had good motives to protect people’s privacy and safety, the bills went too far by fully outlawing the arming of drones with devices that might damage property or hurt people. Now, on first glance, that might not seem like a terrible idea. But on further analysis EFF learned that the bill would criminalize the ability of drone enthusiasts to engage in voluntary aerial combat games, in which drones dogfight with only rudimentary weapons, like a dangling wire to jam an opponent’s rotors. EFF stood up for the rights to innovate and to participate in events like those staged by the Aerial Sports League at Maker Faire SF. We ultimately defeated the bills . Victory for Virtual Currency \nThe California Assembly resurrected a short-sighted proposal to overregulate the virtual currency industry. The bill was fraught with technically inaccurate information and burdensome requirements for start-ups that would ultimately hurt the consumer.

      "text": "Commentary: The Rhodesia Syndrome and its impact on American society: The long journey from Obama to Trump Published on January 2, 2017 By Tiberiu Dianu 1. A New Syndrome For those born after 1980 (Millennials, that is), Rhodesia was an African country led by a white anti-communist militant regime (1965-1980), in a region dominated by black Marxist administrations and military factions self-titled “liberation armies”. Its unique case – during a short-lived existence and especially after -- shows us what happens when a social construction led by competent elites is sacrificed on the altar of political and racial correctness, in the name of some utopian ideals shared by the majority of the local population. The Rhodesia Syndrome is a term that I coin in order to describe the degeneration of a society, partially anomic, whose administration camouflages its perverse socialized communist-type policies through its ethnic narrative overtones about the so-called “racial injustice”. The phenomenon is vividly present here, in America, from the Great Lakes to the Mississippi Delta, and from one coast to another. The same expired theories and bankrupt economic solutions, consistent with the left-wing party activist lines and doubled by racial components, have made today part of communities from Detroit to Atlanta and New Orleans, and from San Francisco to Chicago and Baltimore, to look more like Zimbabwean microcosms. 2. The American Model Like the United States, Rhodesia was a British colony. In 1888, Cecil Rhodes, the British businessman, mining magnate and politician in South Africa, who later on served as a prime minister of the Cape colony (1890-1896), obtained a concession for mining rights from the local tribal leaders. In 1890, he established Fort Salisbury (the current country capital of Harare), in 1895 his company adopted the name “Rhodesia” for the territory, and in 1898 “Southern Rhodesia” became the official name for the region south of the Zambezi River, which later became Zimbabwe. The region north of the river – Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia) -- was administered separately. Rhodesia was annexed by the United Kingdom in 1923, and under the same year new constitution, and subsequent to a 1922 referendum, it became a self-governing British colony. Between 1953 and 1963, in the face of growing African nationalism, the British consolidated the two Rhodesias with Nyasaland (now Malawi) in a Central African Federation (dominated de facto by Southern Rhodesia). With Zambian independence in 1964, Ian Smith’s Rhodesian Front (a white conservative party) issued a Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI) from the United Kingdom on 11 November 1965. The act repudiated the British policy of granting independence without majority rule. Basically, this was the first act of its kind taken by a British colony since the 1776 American Declaration of Independence, which Smith claimed provided a suitable precedent to his actions. Unlike the United States though, the British did not send troops “to subdue the first national treason against the Crown since the American War of Independence, but opted -- through their then Labour prime minister Harold Wilson -- for sanctions instead. 3. An Integrated Society By that time, Rhodesia – in comparison with the United States at the time of their independence – was a more integrated state, socially, electorally, and militarily. Rhodesian society was not shaped after the American segregation system of the pre-70s, or the South African apartheid system of the pre-90s. The electoral system followed Cecil Rhodes’s dictum of “equal rights for all civilized men”, with no overt racial component to the franchise. But since the requirement excluded a majority of native blacks from the electorate, it geared to resist to majority rule. The system was based on the Westminster Parliamentary System, modified by a system of separate black and white electoral rolls (A and B, each with qualifications), with differing property and education qualifications, without regard to race. Being wealthier and more educated, whites ended up with the majority of the parliamentary seats. However, the mechanism whereby the number of black members of parliament would increase in line with the proportion of income tax revenues paid by black citizens, was up to the moment blacks had the same number of seats as whites, since the declared goal was “parity between the races” rather than majority rule (cf. Phillippa Berlyn, The Quiet Man: A Biography of Ian Douglas Smith , M O Collins Publishers, Salisbury, 1978, pp. 240-256). The importance of education during the electoral act – during a surge of ideological egalitarianism preached by most of the African black leaders of the time -- was properly emphasized by the Rhodesian prime minister Ian Smith in an April 28, 1974 televised interview with William F. Buckley, Jr. The issue has kept its importance until today, vis-à-vis the Millennials’ appetency in voting for “Free Stuff Matters”-type of policies tested elsewhere with disastrous results, and the “Black Lives Matter” anti-marginalization and entitlement movement. The non-segregated military and police forces were well-equipped and operationally efficient. Rhodesia had contributed, per head of population, more in both world wars than any part of the British Empire, including the United Kingdom itself. 4. A Man for All Seasons During its fifteen years of existence, Rhodesia crossed several stages: (1) Unilaterally declared independent commonwealth, as Rhodesia (November 11, 1965); (2) Unilaterally declared parliamentary republic, as Rhodesia (March 2, 1970); (3) Unilaterally declared parliamentary republic, as Zimbabwe Rhodesia (June 1, 1979 to December 12, 1979), and (4) Re-established British Commonwealth, as Southern Rhodesia (December 12, 1979 to April 17, 1980). After that, Zimbabwe was internationally recognized as an independent state (April 18, 1980). The country used the Rhodesian pound during 1965-1970, and the Rhodesian dollar during 1970-1979. Ian Smith (1919-2007), the country’s prime minister not born abroad, was a man with love for his people and land, and a true patriot. He was born in the small farming town of Selukwe, southwest of Salisbury, and studied farming at a Salisbury agricultural college. From his father, a rancher, he inherited solid principles of fairness and moral values. Smith acquired a Victorian vision of the world, both in moral standards and in the belief of British primacy that characterized the empire. In his 1997 autobiography, The Bitter Harvest: The Great Betrayal , Smith recollects about his father: “He always told me that we’re entitled to our half of the country and the blacks are entitled to theirs.” After retiring from political life, he spent some of his later years at his Gwenoro ranch, near Selukwe. During the Second World War, he was a Royal Air Force officer pilot and flew combat missions in the Middle East and Europe. His task – of keeping Rhodesia afloat – was almost a “mission impossible.” Given the impact of economic and diplomatic sanctions, the country was still able to develop and maintain a significant and professional military and police capability. 5. A Divided Black Society On the domestic front, Smith cracked down hard on the two black nationalist Marxist parties and their guerrilla movements, in what is called “ the Bush War ” (1964-1979). Since both black militant groups (whose members saw their parties as “national liberation movements”) were operating from the outside – Joshua Nkomo’s Zimbabwe African People’s Union (ZAPU) from Zambia, and Robert Mugabe’s Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU) from Mozambique – Rhodesian authorities treated them as external communist threats. ZAPU was logistically supported by Soviet Russia (plus Cuba, East Germany, and others), while ZANU (initially a ZAPU dissident wing turned into a party) was receiving support from Maoist China (plus Mozambique, Tanzania, Libya, and others). However, neither militant group possessed basic knowledge of guerrilla warfare, which basically allowed the Rhodesian army to maintain the control in the theaters of operations . The control was maintained despite a 22 to 1 black-to-white ratio . Other factors for their inefficiency consisted in tribal differences. ZANU consisted mainly in Shona tribe members (80% of the population), while ZAPU was formed basically by Ndebele tribe members (20% of the population, spread mostly in the South-West). 6. A World with Too Few Friends On the international arena, Rhodesia’s early counter-insurgency successes were neutralized to a great extent by the Western powers themselves (some of them early allies), like United Nations, United Kingdom (called “Perfidious Albion” by Smith in his memoirs), United States, South Africa, and Portugal. Tiberiu Dianu has published several books and over 100 articles in law, politics, and post-communist societies. He currently lives and works in Washington, DC, and can be followed on Medium . https://medium.com/@tdianu Immediately after 1965 UDI, the British Labour Party government, followed by the United Nations’ Security Council, started to apply economic sanctions (countered to an extent by the Rhodesian government and companies in cooperation with some third states’ authorities). The United States, although it refused to recognize Rhodesia, allowed its Consulate-General to function as a communications conduit between the American government in Washington, DC, and the Rhodesian government in Salisbury. Rhodesia set up an information office in Washington, DC, which remained open after UDI, but its staff was deprived of their diplomatic status. In April 1974, as a result of the socialist Carnation Revolution in Lisbon, the sympathetic right-wing Salazar regime was removed, together with Portugal previous political and economic support. Portugal’s withdrawal from its colonies led neighboring Mozambique turn into a communist state openly allied with ZANU. In December 1974, South African prime minister Vorster pressured Smith into accepting a détente policy involving Rhodesia frontline states, outlining that South African interests (the apartheid policy, that is) would be better served by cooperating with the black African governments over a Rhodesian deal. In 1976, the US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger pushed for a deal of his own, involving the principle of majority rule, which Smith reluctantly conceded to, in exchange for an “internal settlement” with more moderate black leaders (like bishop Abel Muzorewa). A Geneva Conference was organized from October 28 to December 14 the same year, presided by the British Labour Party member Ivor Richard, in order to implement Kissinger’s agreement terms, but since some black nationalists from Rhodesia refused to recognize the agreement, no progress was made. 7. From Rhodesia to Zimbabwe Once Zimbabwe had become an internationally recognized independent state, as a presidential republic (April 18, 1980), the degeneration of society began. The new leader Robert Mugabe, an avowed Marxist-Leninist, triggered a vast military operation, called Gukurahundi , for neutralizing the ZAPU “dissident” members. The task was carried out by his personal North Korean trained paramilitary Fifth Brigade, held responsible for killing an estimated ten to thirty thousand Ndebele people, in the South-Western province of Matabeleland and its capital, Bulawayo. Ultimately, this led to a unity accord (December 22, 1987), effectively dissolving ZAPU into ZANU, renamed Zimbabwe African National Union – Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF), and paving the way toward a one-party system. The destruction of society continued in the following decades. The 1990s were marked by anti-Mugabe social protests organized by students, trade unions, and health personnel, related to poor life standards (reportedly, 25% of the population had been infected by HIV in 1997). The 2000 land reform (the “fast track” version) involved compulsory land acquisitions and confiscations from the white farmers, holders of some 70% of the country agricultural land. In 2002, as a result of the continuing degradation of the society – white farms seizures, gross economic mismanagement, electoral and human rights violations – the country is suspended from the (former British) Commonwealth of Nations. In 2008, Mugabe was controversially re-elected as president, but the opposition party of Movement for Democratic Change – Tsvangirai (MDC-T) won the parliamentary elections, and their leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, becomes prime minister. In 2013, a new constitution has extended Mugabe’s presidential powers (followed by his re-election, with accusations of vote rigging). As a result of grossly mismanaging of economy and corruption in society, the formal unemployment rate reached 80%, while inflation rose from an annual rate of 32% in 1998 to a high of 11,200,000%, which represented a state of hyperinflation, and a new 100 billion dollar note was introduced by the central bank. That marked the abandonment of the national currency. Mugabe was a die-hard fan of printing money, and so was president Obama in the same fatidic year of 2008 and after, when the US national debt had peaked to several trillions of dollars. The only difference between the Rhodesian dollar and the US dollar was that the latter one still had credibility on the market. 8. Degeneration and Decline Another visible effect in the post-independent Zimbabwe has been the rapid decline of the white community. The white population dropped from 7% (1960) to 4% (1975), then 2% (1999), 1% (2002), and reached 0.20% (2012). A Zimbabwe National Statistics Agency (ZIMSTAT) Report specified that out of the total population of 13,061,239 residents, the European ethnic group counted only for 28,732 residents (see: ZIMSTAT, 2012, p. 22 ). Between 1980 and 1990, two thirds of the white émigrés (nicknamed Rhodies) left the country. About 50% of them went to South Africa, about 30% to United Kingdom and Ireland, and 20% to United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. The other third consisted in non-émigrés (nicknamed Zimbos ), who did so either because they were wealthy and/or skilled, or poor and unable to emigrate. Most of the remaining white Rhodesians are elderly. For them, and old elite of the country, the slogan has become “Farewell, Rhodesia! Hello, Zimbabwe!” The phenomenon has also characterized the last decades of some large American cities. A more recent trend shows a discrete reverse, but some are skeptical that this reversed trend will hold. Still, it is worth mentioning that in 2014, while in Rhodesia the white community is becoming progressively extinct, in the neighboring Zambia (former Northern Rhodesia), a white acting president becomes breaking news. 9. The Rhodesian and American Models Some striking resemblances between Rhodesians and Americans deserve to be pointed out: -- The sense of belonging to a great nation, carrying the same solid values and frontier spirit (vis-à-vis the American pioneers and minutemen, and the early Rhodesian Englishmen settlers); -- Collective upholders of principle and defenders of values against both decadence of Britain itself, and communism worldwide; -- Front-line states against communist expansion (in Africa, for Rhodesia, in the world, for the US); -- Christian heritage of their pioneer ancestors in “defending the free world”; -- retaining their own economic prosperity through a gradual progression to other racial/ethnic groups. Unfortunately for Rhodesia, all these sets of values gained little international recognition during its existence. The gradual progression to black majority rule was seen by the international community as a rationale perpetuating policies of racism. The attitude of the Western powers was rooted in a larger decolonization context, during which countries like United Kingdom, France, Spain, Portugal, and Belgium hastened to grant independence to their colonies in Africa. There are some factors that explain why the white rule in Rhodesia lasted for so long, namely from 1895 to 1980. First, Rhodesia was longtime considered the Africa’s breadbasket. White farmers were skilled, and after the 1980s the black farmers’ low skills or lack of incentives have led to a farming policy with disastrous results. Second, the country’s two main ethnic groups, the Shona and the Ndebele, were many times more in conflicting than in partner relationships. It was said that, in a way, Rhodesia’s white administration was the black majority chance for a balanced approach, toward prosperity and the creation of a solid middle class. There are also some lessons to be learned from Rhodesia’s case. Domestically (nationally and locally), going along racial lines and political convenience against the expertise of the few can be the sure recipe for economic disaster. Regionally , your neighbors can be both good and bad, but at the end of the day they can all turn up being even worse. Internationally , your allies’ diplomacy of duplicity, followed by treachery, will be pursued for their own pure self-interest, and later justified by “principles and requirements” of Realpolitik . But in the end, even if you remain alone with your pride, standards and values, you can rest assured that your place in history has been secured. Or, put it in Ian Smith’s own prophetic words: “I told you so!” 10. A Close Call for America Barack Obama has not realized, or did not want to realize, that both his election and reelection as the president of the United States (in 2008 and 2012, respectively) were possible through the votes of the white Americans. Whites alone (the European-Americans) comprise 72.4% of the US population, while blacks (or African-Americans) are only 12.6%. Ignoring this basic truth and choosing to rule in a divisive manner throughout his two mandates, Obama has alienated a large portion of whites, mostly from the rural areas but also from some significant urban regions of the country (both from the South and the Mid-West, including the Great Lakes area). As a result, Donald Trump won white non-Hispanic voters by a 21 percentage points compared to Hillary Clinton (57% to 37%), slightly better than Mitt Romney in 2012 (20 percentage points, 59% to 39% compared with Barack Obama). Trump has fared a little better among blacks (8% compared to 6%) and Hispanics (28% compared with 27%) than Romney did in 2012. Constantly criticized and ridiculed by the politically correct segments of the American society and the mainstream media, the “silent majority” of whites (within an impressive arch, ranging from the white nationalists, traditional conservatives and the alt-righters to the independents and moderate democrats) voted in an extremely disciplined and efficient manner. These “forgotten men and women” have offered a caveat to the unsuspecting Establishment, who tried to foresee their intention by using corrupted polls, and who has constantly ignored them, belittled them, and taken them for granted for so many decades. In a sustained effort to defend their core traditional values and principles, the white electorate in the United States has regained its voice and avoided the Rhodesia syndrome to take over the American society for the years to come.",

      "text": "Robert V. Boyd \nZacks Investment Research upgraded shares of Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (NYSE:RCL) from a sell rating to a hold rating in a research report report published on Tuesday morning. \nAccording to Zacks, “Royal Caribbean’s third-quarter adjusted earnings of $3.20 per share were 3.2% ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate which was the same as management’s guided $3.10. Further, earnings increased 12.7% year over year due to higher revenues. Revenues of $2.53 billion missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.7% but increased 1.6% year over year. Going forward, strong booking trends, capacity growth and various profit-generating initiatives should drive growth. Also, the company’s North American products and Asia-Pacific itineraries are likely to continue performing strongly as has been the case over the past few quarters. However, higher costs might hurt the company’s profitability in the near-term. Further, despite the growth opportunities, lingering global uncertainties in China and Europe along with negative impact of the foreign currency translation is likely to mar the company’s international profits.” \nRCL has been the subject of a number of other reports.

      "text": "Living Through an Age of Unraveling Reflections as we enter 2017 A world of extremes: billboard in Mumbai, India promotes the \"Trump Way to Live\" in front of homeless people. \n“There is nothing in a caterpillar that tells you it's going to be a butterfly.” ― R. Buckminster Fuller \nFor the past millennia, our civilization has been built on the idea of harsh power. Power of men over women, of rulers over people, of man over nature. It's been the power to kill and destroy and not the power of life, which is to create and regenerate life. Man saw himself as subject to the overpowering authority of a punitive god and in turn, authorized himself to rule this Earth as its master and dominator. This notion of life has essentially characterized our world from the construction of the Egyptian pyramids to today's globalized neoliberal capitalism, and now it is rapidly coming down. The idea of power has left us with a world-spanning system of society, politics and economics recklessly exploiting nature, powering its progress through cheap energy exploited from the Earth. This system currently runs like a severe drug addict: flashed by the effects of a quickly growing oil-based economy, it has bound its existence to infinite growth, continuous oil supply and endless global expansion. It has now entered a process of self-destruction not only because it has impoverished and waged war against large parts of humanity, and crossed planetary boundaries crucial for the health and sustainability of the biosphere, but also because its inner contradictions make it harder and harder for it to sustain itself. \nThroughout this year we've seen the disintegration of this system – underway for a while already – reaching whole new dimensions. Two weeks ago one of America's senior conservative leaders, John McCain, openly warned in unusually blatant words that our current world order is, in fact, “ unraveling .” \nWhile the unraveling McCain fears implies the loss of America's global hegemony, there are billions of beings on this planet who experience this unraveling as something very real and existential. The times of unraveling are times of unprecedented global pain. When we face what people stuck in the war in Syria or Yemen, constantly surrendered to bombings while freezing and starving to death, need to suffer, just to give one out of thousands examples from around this planet, we are confronted with a pain that is simply too hard to bear or make sense of. Every day, the news agencies bombard us with these and similar images of a dying world – refugees washed ashore, species going extinct at record levels, explosions of hatred and revenge everywhere – and the question is, how do we respond? At an elementary level, it comes down to two options—either we suppress what we face and decide to simply continue living our lives as if nothing is going on, or we take a stand for those suffering, for an end of the atrocities, for a different world. \nWhat kind of future we will have depends on which of the two we chose. The first response is one of fear; it seals off the pain, but it leads to a reality of apathy and totalitarianism. The second response is one of empathy and confronts us with the pain, but is the only way for a humane world to arise. This past year we've seen both sides – fear and compassion – emerge and struggle with each other. With scores of refugees pouring into Europe last winter, we've seen the beautiful, empathic potential of humanity revealing itself in thousands upon thousands of volunteers selflessly giving their all to support those fleeing. In addition to immediate aid relief, this kind of humane awakening requires a political strategy for system change to be effective in the long run. \nIn 2016, for the first time in history, the richest one percent of the global population owns more than the other 99% combined. For decades, people in the Western world have played along in the capitalist game, satisfied by the rewards the consumption industries offered them for taking up the roles assigned to them. Yet, latest since the recession in 2008, popular anger against the workings of banks and corporations has grown so massive, people no longer believe they will benefit from globalization. \nBernie Sanders' presidential campaign in the United States showed just how strong the longing for another culture has become in the heartland of global capitalism, especially among young people. Addressing economic injustices of the neoliberal order, Sanders mobilized millions across the nation and became a serious threat to the candidate of the political establishment. To save Clinton's campaign, the Democratic Party systematically sabotaged his campaign and thereby helped a proto-fascist billionaire to assume presidency. In 2016, we painfully saw what happens when outrage and indignation isn't allowed to find a constructive channel—it turns destructive and ugly. As Frankfurt School philosopher Walter Benjamin put it, “Behind every fascism, there is a failed revolution.” \nBoth the Brexit vote in the UK and the election of Donald Trump in the US were articulations of people's rage against the machine, votes fueled by popular outrage against the globalized “establishment.” Both events would have seemed unthinkable for most people even a year ago. A country with one of the world's largest economies stepping out of such a union would have seemed ridiculous in this globalized world. Brexit marks a stop for capital's expansiveness, for its compulsory drive towards ever-larger economic unions and trade zones. This is a real problem for the system. Brexit is likely to speed up the collapse of the European Union altogether, something that might happen as early as 2017. \nAs there's growing uncertainty over the future, far-right movements are triumphing around the world by turning people's fears into political capital. Trump, to cite the most startling example, was elected because he understood how to channel people's fears and anger—just to make them vote for the most extreme version of the very system that has generated much of their fear and anger in the first place. At times of crisis and public rebellion, Trump comes in as a savior of capitalist interests, of Wall Street, the military-industrial complex and above all, the oil and gas industry. One of Trump's ardent supporters, the Silicon Valley billionaire, Peter Thiel, has long argued that capitalism needs to be “saved” from democracy . The system has become so shaken that it can no longer afford its marriage with democracy. It needs the state to function as a guard, making sure its economic conditions are maintained. According to Thiel's vision, the state shouldn't interfere in business, and restrict people's abilities to interfere in business; it should increase authoritarian rule and boost surveillance to crush resistance and wage conflict between different ethnic, cultural and religious groups to distract people from the actual injustices. Trump seems committed to turn this dystopian vision into reality. \nLet's not be deceived: Trump is neither an anomaly nor an outsider to the system. His rise to power came from within the American society, not Russia. Both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump represent the exact same system and work for the same banks and corporations. The 2016 Presidential Election wasn't about fundamental systemic questions; it was a test as to whether “business as usual” could continue in the United States (and therefore the Western world at large) in the framework of a liberal democracy or whether a totalitarian type of regime would become necessary to maintain that system. It proved to be the latter. (Yet, the shift from democracy to authoritarian rule is only possible because there wasn't a genuine democracy in the first place. The current fuss about the alleged “fake news” spread by Russia just shows that people in the West apparently hadn’t any clue as to what extent public opinion in so called “free democratic societies” has been engineered and manipulated all along to make sure “the people” behave according to the elite's interests.) \nWhat is most particularly threatened is America's oil-based “petrodollar” economy. Oil isn't just an important part of the Western economy, “it is the economy,” says the environmentalist Bill McKibben. In fact, the strength of the US Dollar directly relies on oil ever since President Nixon suspended the convertibility of the Dollar into gold in the 1970s. We all know about the brutal “oil wars” of George W. Bush and the kind of devastation and terrorism they unleashed over entire countries, but they started far longer than a decade ago. Today the situation around petroleum is much more severe. We're past “peak oil,” meaning oil exploitation is declining worldwide. Simultaneously solar has surpassed oil and gas in terms of efficiency in 2016 . Trump's cabinet picks show his administration's number one priority will be trying to keep up the petrodollar system, making sure that black gold will continue to flow abundantly and be traded in US Dollars. \nAt this stage, the price for maintaining this system has become incredibly high, demanding nature be destroyed at whole new dimensions and global currency wars waged that might as well escalate into military confrontation, i.e. between America and China. \nIn the end, however, all these efforts will be as effective as those of Don Quixote to defeat the windmills. The more and the longer the dominant system will try to resist the necessary system change from happening, the more crushing will be its eventual collapse. Its response to the crisis is nothing but pathological because, even though the ruling elites want us to think otherwise, there no longer is any vision for the future within the system. Its only prospect now is one of short-term profit and survival. Large parts of humanity are denying what is happening. And instead of changing, the systems intensifies its (self-)destructive behavior – and will probably try to continue all the way to the end. \nWhat's the way forward? \n2017 will likely see the unraveling speed up even more. We must not think this is the end of the world, but a transition from a system that is no longer coherent to a new one that is yet to be born. Alongside all the pain, we face a historic possibility for an evolutionary leap forward, for building a global culture in alignment with all fellow beings and the Earth. To see this potential, we must learn to shift the focus from what breaks down to what wants to break through. \nA powerful, recent example of this transformative impulse has been the struggle at Standing Rock in North Dakota, where Indigenous water protectors have resisted an oil pipeline since April. At the resistance camp, Indigenous people came together with veterans, hard-core political activists, environmentalists, Burning Man folks, rainbow people and spiritual seekers. People from across all camps banded together beyond their usual ideological divisions, because they were united by a common spiritual calling – life's inherent sacredness and the imperative to defend and preserve it. Standing Rock drew thousands of veterans – men and women who fought for the U.S. Army in Afghanistan and Iraq – to join them in defending water, land and Native people's rights. Engaging in nonviolent action, many of them said that this was the first time they really served the American people. The struggle at Standing Rock fused political activism with spiritual consciousness – and thereby revealed the power of nonviolent resistance we will need in the coming months and years. It is no longer the old power to destroy and kill, but a gentle power to create and safeguard life, anchored into the awareness of our interconnectedness with all beings. This consciousness is key to the emergence a humane future. In its essence, the upcoming global transformation will consist of a system change from separation and fear to reconnection and service to the sacred. The power we need to heal the world from the wounds of history is the power of unreserved trust. “Trust,” the psychoanalyst Dieter Duhm says, “is not just a psychological, but a revolutionary term – the most revolutionary of all – because we need to turn our entire society upside down to develop structural sustainable trust.” \nAs the present order crumbles, a new culture could now start to emerge – given there's a coherent vision available for it. Evolution doesn't move gradually, but in leaps. Once a new evolutionary pattern starts to become visible and manifests in the first places, our overall situation can radically transform – and quickly so. How the future will look depends on the visions we see and activate. Our way forward as humanity will begin by radically reimagining our civilization. If we are able to see the basic pattern for a nonviolent civilization, a culture of solidarity and trust in all areas, we can midwife the global transition and make the apparently impossible possible – building a world without wars and cruelties. \nEven though lots of attention is absorbed by the catastrophes, there has never been as much knowledge for creating a regenerative, collaborative and nonviolent world as today. People across the globe – inventors, ecologists, futuristic communities, artists, living experiments – have long been working for another possible direction of global development in different areas. A planetary community is slowly emerging beyond the old limitations of religions, cultures and ideologies; people in all different pockets of this world working in service for the greater good of all – on restoring nature, on building decentralized autonomous settlements, regenerative economies, and energy technologies for a post-carbon era, but also on establishing a new relation to animals based on respect and conscious communication, forming communities of trust, healing our consciousness and freeing love from fear. These are signals for the birth of a new era. \nStill, these impulses are single patches spread across the world. To transform this beautiful and inspiring, but still rather amorphous and disorganized fringe movement into a serious alternative for this world, it needs a global vision and realistic strategy for change. To transcend and replace the current system, it is crucial for these single puzzle pieces to be combined into a coherent system. Only a new system can overcome the old; no invention alone – however genius or revolutionary it might be – is able to do that. For this to happen we need pilot projects – we may call them “World Future Sites” or “Healing Biotopes”– in which all the essential components for a nonviolent and regenerative future are researched and combined into replicable societal blueprints. The more such centers progress, the more they can radiate and broaden the horizon of collective imagination. Additionally, we need media channels and educational pathways for people to get to know and participate in the emerging new culture and an international platform for this movement to encounter and establish itself. The Bernie Sanders campaign, Occupy Wall Street and other recent progressive movements have shown that potentially millions of people would be ready to take part in the creation of a different society were they offered credible orientation. This is the task at hand. \n2016 saw an accelerating unraveling of the old system. In 2017, the basic features of a new system could start to crystalize globally. The architect and futurist Buckminster Fuller believed that finding out how to manage spaceship Earth would be humanity's final exam. This is the process we're finding ourselves in right now.

      "text": "Western Canada separation would be a messy procedure Bill Peckham Kelownadailycourier.ca | 0 comments \nEditor: \nRe: letter of Dec. 26, from Mike Polvere in The Daily Courier: “Western Canada should separate before the drunken sailors ruin it all.” \nYour letter gave me pause to think about a divorce from the rest of Canada, and I believe it is incumbent upon me to point out a few flaws in your thinking. \nIn theory, your letter seems to make sense, but when I dig deeper into the possibility of a divorce, between Canada and the West, I find several things, which I am sure you have not considered. \nThink about this: \nThe West would need its own monetary policy, separate and apart from Canada’s policies. \nA central bank would be required to monitor and drive the economy and set national interest rates. \nThe West would need its own currency. Thus it would require a national mint to design and strike coins and print bills. \nWestern passports would be a pre-requisite for independence; can’t use Canadian passports. \nA full diplomatic corps would have to be formed, complete with embassies in other countries, staffed with experienced and qualified diplomats, assistants, secretaries, etc. These embassies would require security staff, well trained in dealing with potential threats and violence. \nA full military force would have to be organized, trained and supplied with weapons to protect this new country. \nSince this new country would have international borders to the east, north, south and a coastline to the west border security, immigration and customs officers would need to be recruited and trained. \nThe West would not be allowed to use the RCMP, therefore a national police force would have to be recruited, trained, detachment buildings built and forensic labs built and staffed. Maybe Canada would sell us those things that the RCMP currently uses. You can bet that we wouldn’t get bargain basement prices on them. \nNow, when the RCMP leaves the west, every city, town, village, hamlet and settlement would need its own police force. I could go on here with a new justice system, federal laws, judges and courthouses with all the accompanying staff. \nJust to top all of this off, a new charter of rights would have to be written, new treaties with First Nations must be negotiated and written, and we know how that would go. What if, as happened in Quebec, the First Nations refused to separate with the West? That would mean there would be pockets of Canadian First Nations tribes sprinkled all over the West. Just look at a map and see for yourself. \nI could go on, but I think you can see that it is not just a simple job of saying, “We are going to divorce you Canada.” Divorce is never simple, and there are many people who can attest to that. \nThanks for the suggestion, but no thanks, I can’t afford a divorce. Our system may not be the best, but the alternative is worse. \nBill Peckham, Kelowna",

      "text": "What it means if Trump names China a currency manipulator Paul Wiseman, The Associated Press \nPublished: January 01, 2017 \nUpdated: January 02, 2017 5:46 AM Filed Under: Tumblr \nWASHINGTON - President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to name China a currency manipulator on his first day in the White House. \nThere's only one problem - it's not true anymore. China, the world's second-biggest economy behind the United States, hasn't been pushing down its currency to benefit Chinese exporters in years. And even if it were, the law targeting manipulators requires the U.S. spend a year negotiating a solution before it can retaliate. \nTrump spent much of the campaign blaming China for America's economic woes. And it's true that the U.S-China trade relationship is lopsided. China sells a lot more to the United States than it buys. The resulting trade deficit in goods amounted to a staggering $289 billion through the first 10 months of 2016. \nBut in fact, for the past couple of years China has been intervening in markets to prop up its currency, the yuan, not push it lower. \nIt went a step further on Thursday, watering down the significance of the dollar and adding 11 additional currencies in a foreign-exchange basket, according to a document released by the China Foreign Exchange Trading System. \nWHAT DOES CURRENCY HAVE TO DO WITH THE TRADE GAP? \nWhen China's yuan falls against the U.S. dollar, Chinese products become cheaper in the U.S. market and American products become more costly in China. \nSo the U.S. Treasury Department monitors China for signs it is manipulating the yuan lower. Treasury has guidelines for putting countries on its currency blacklist. They must, for example, have spent the equivalent of 2 per cent of their economic output over a year buying foreign currencies in an attempt to drive those currencies up and their own currencies down. \nTreasury hasn't declared China a currency manipulator since 1994. \nWHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THE US DECLARED CHINA A CURRENCY MANIPULATOR? \nProbably not much, at least initially. \nIf Treasury designates China a currency manipulator under a 2015 law, it is supposed to spend a year trying to resolve the problem through negotiations. \nShould those talks fail, the U.S. can take a number of small steps in retaliation, including stopping the U.S. Overseas Private Investment Corp., a government development agency, from financing any programs in China. Trouble is, the United States already suspended OPIC operations in China years ago — to punish Beijing in the aftermath of the bloody 1989 crackdown in Tiananmen Square. \nSo naming China a currency manipulator is mostly \"just a jaw-boning exercise,\" said Amanda DeBusk, chair of the international trade department at the law firm of Hughes Hubbard & Reed and a former Commerce Department official. \"There's no immediate consequence.\" \nIS CHINA GUILITY OF USING CURRENCY TO HELP ITS EXPORTERS? \nFor years, China pretty clearly manipulated its currency to gain an advantage over global competitors. It bought foreign currencies, the U.S. dollar in particular, to push them higher against the yuan. As it did, it accumulated vast foreign currency reserves — nearly $4 trillion worth by mid-2014. \nBut now the Chinese economy is slowing, and Chinese companies and individuals have begun to invest more heavily outside the country. As their money leaves China, it puts downward pressure on the yuan. \nThe yuan has dropped nearly 7 per cent against the dollar so far this year. The Chinese government has responded by draining its foreign exchange reserves to buy yuan, hoping to slow the currency's fall. China's reserves have dropped by $279 billion this year to $3.05 trillion. \nIf Beijing stepped back and let market forces determine the yuan's level, it likely would fall even faster, giving Chinese exporters even more of a competitive edge. \nSo Beijing is doing the opposite of what Trump says it's doing. Cornell University economist Eswar Prasad earlier this month called Trump's plans to name China a currency manipulator \"unmoored from reality.\" \n\"The whole discussion is ironic,\" said David Dollar, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former official at the World Bank and U.S. Treasury Department. \"It's out of date.\" \nCOULD TRUMP DO ANYTHING ON HIS OWN? \nGary Hufbauer, an expert on trade law at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, notes that as president, Trump could nonetheless escalate any dispute over the currency on his own. Over the years, Congress has ceded the president broad authority to impose trade sanctions. Trump has threatened to slap a 45 per cent tax, or tariff, on Chinese imports to punish it for unfair trade practices, including alleged currency manipulation. \nBrookings' Dollar said China likely would bring a case to the World Trade Organization \"against any protectionist measures that are a violation of U.S. commitments to the WTO,\" which oversees the rules of global commerce and rules on trade disputes. \nSome trade analysts wonder if Trump is using the tariff threat as a negotiating tool to win concessions from China. \nWhatever the U.S. motive, China has a consistent record of retaliating against trade sanctions. When the Obama administration slapped tariffs on Chinese tire imports in 2009, for instance, China lashed back by imposing a tax on U.S. chicken parts. \nChina's Global Times newspaper, published by the ruling Communist Party's People's Daily, has already speculated that \"China will take a tit-for-tat approach\" if Trump's tariffs are enacted. The paper suggested that Beijing might limit sales of Apple iPhones and Boeing jetliners in China. \n\"The Chinese are predictable and reliable,\" DeBusk said. \"If they get punched, they punch back.\" \n___",

To submit a letter by e-mail, click here: letters@globeandmail.com\nBecause it’s 2017: A prediction\nA safe New Year’s prediction: Donald Trump will make America grate again.\nColin Read, London, Ont.\nBecause it’s 2017: Mideast diplomacy\nThe convoluted language of diplomacy in the Mideast file is going by the wayside. Plain talk, for at least a few moments as we enter 2017, is the common currency of communication. So here are a few blunt truths:\n1) The peace process is moribund;\n2) There is no effective representative Palestinian leadership to engage in negotiations;\n3) Israel has virtually solved the problem of suicide bombers, and has no incentive to negotiate land for peace;\n4) As a result, bilateral negotiations between Palestinians and Israel are impossible;\n5) Without an internationally mandated intervention to conduct multilateral negotiations, there will be no viable Palestinian state.\nWhy so? To vary what has be-come an adage: Because it’s 2017.\nHoward Greenfield, Montreal\nRe Ignore The Noise: Resolution 2334 Has Global Support (Dec. 30): Paul Heinbecker asks, “If the United States were to walk away from the UN, as some suggest, who would shield Israel then?”\nThe U.S. will never abandon Israel because of the strong lobby group it has there. As proof, witness the $10-billion military aid package to be given to Israel over the next 10 years, as noted in your editorial (Cutting Off The Only Path To Real Peace – Dec. 30).\nThere is no significant incentive for Israel to compromise and give up the settlements when it has that kind of U.S. military support. Imagine the unimaginable for a moment and a different U.S. tactic – there will be no $10-billion military aid as long as there are more settlements. Instead, the United States abstained from voting on Resolution 2334.\nDavid Enns, Cornwall, Ont.\nIsraeli prime ministers Ehud Barak and Ehud Olmert each negotiated with the Palestinian leadership and offered them statehood. The offers involved concessions on settlements, including dismantling many of them. And both of those prime ministers oversaw more new settlement construction than has occurred under Benjamin Netanyahu. Yet you say settlement construction undermines the peace process and stands to make a two-state deal impossible. Israeli settlement construction hinders the peace process only because the Palestinian Authority uses it as an excuse not to come to the table. Resolution 2334 significantly bolsters that excuse and will serve the PA well in its efforts to avoid accepting a state for its long-suffering people.\nDaniel Fogel, Toronto\nObjecting to the building of settlements in the West Bank is all very well but one has to accept reality. As long as Israel is flanked by states that deny its right to exist there is absolutely no possibility of a two-state solution.\nPassivity to threats had disastrous consequences for the Jewish people and there is no way they are going to follow that path again, regardless of the “rights” or “wrongs” of their action.\nD.J. Lloyd, Kingston\nBecause it’s 2017: Canada and arms\nIn 2017, Canada will finally join the UN Arms Trade Treaty, and Canadians must put pressure on the government to ensure that this translates into real change in the weapons trade. The tragedy in Syria is fuelled by a constant supply of arms from the West; Canada is the second-largest exporter of arms to the Middle East. This shames me as a Canadian.\nThe West has been criticized for its “collective inaction” in Syria, but I would argue that the West has been very active, and that we urgently need to consider how our actions in the business-as-usual model of capitalism have contributed to this tragedy.\nThe arms trade is one of two big areas where short-term, narrow financial interests have trumped social and environmental responsibility and contributed to a cycle of war. Climate change is the other. Both are areas where Canada has acted wrongly, and where by righting our actions we can make a real peace-building difference. Severe ongoing drought exacerbated by climate change significantly contributed to the food shortages that precipitated the war in Syria. Now, the UN is predicting that south Sudan is soon to become uninhabitable due to climate change, and many other regions are at similar risk.\nCanada needs to keep its climate commitments, keep the fossil fuels in the ground, and meet our promised funding for climate-change mitigation in vulnerable regions. We need to do everything we can to be a world leader in climate justice, to stop prioritizing blind economic growth over the well-being of people, planet, and peace.\nThis is how we can truly help the people of Syria.\nRebecca Weigand, Toronto\nBecause it’s 2017: A health accord\nIf the provinces want to improve access to care and reduce pressures on hospitals, they need to in-vest in mental health. Now. Provinces that haven’t reached a deal with Ottawa, and that includes Ontario, should accept the federal offer on mental-health and home-care funding and continue to discuss the size of health transfers with the federal government.\nThe mental-health and home-care investments will increase capacity to provide services in people’s homes and the community while reducing pressure on hospital services, a major driver of increased health care costs.\nUnder the last accord, the provinces failed to make needed investments in mental-health services. For example, between 2004 and 2011, Ontario invested $16.45 per capita in mental health services, while putting $1,361 per capita into other areas of health care. Compare that to Australia, which invested $98.13 in mental-health services, New Zealand’s $198 and the U.K, which invested $62.22. Provinces aren’t meeting the 2012 health spending targets of 9 per cent recommended by the Mental Health Commission.\nOntario’s mental-health share of health spending is some 6 per cent, Saskatchewan’s is 5 per cent. Without more funds, wait lists and wait times will keep growing.\nIn Ontario, young people are waiting up to 18 months for mental-health assessments and services, in Toronto, 2,000 people are waiting up to a year to access community mental-health services. The wait list for supportive housing has over 12,000 names, with wait times of up to seven years.\nSteve Lurie, executive director, CMHA Toronto\nBecause it’s 2017: Canada’s envoy?\nWith Donald Trump about to take over in Washington on Jan. 20, we should have an ambassador there who can match his forceful manner, colourful personality, total freedom from any excessive modesty – and ideally have some show business experience.\nSuch individuals are rare, but I think we are lucky in having one person who would fully meet all those exacting requirements: Don Cherry.\nAndrzej Derkowski, Oakville, Ont.",

      "text": "How many times have you realised that you have accidentally erased a critical file from your computer? Well, there is good news, because if you act fast you might be able to recover the file\nStep One\nCheck your recycle bin to see if the file is still there. The Recycle Bin holds files before deleting them, thus permitting you to restore them should you change your mind. To restore a file, open the Recycle Bin, right-click on the file, then select Restore. The file will return to its original position on the hard drive.\nStep Two\nStop accessing the drive. If your files cannot be found in the Recycle Bin, save or delete nothing on your computer. You will have better chances of finding the file if you dont save anything new.\nStep Three\nDownload program for data recovery on another computer, or another drive. Be careful not to save the program on the drive that you are trying to recover the file from. Some of the popular data recovery programs that you can get for free include Recuva, Glary Undelete, MiniTool Partition Recovery, Puran File Recovery\nStep Four\nRun the downloaded recovery program. Follow the basic steps.\nStep Five\nBe precise at what you are searching. Make sure the recovery program is searching at the disk that the file was at the time it was deleted. You can specify file type, name and date of creation.\nStep Six\nWhen the program has finished scanning, look through the result list to check if your fie is included. If you have found it, select your file and click the Restore button.

      "text": "Bitcoin Rises Above $1000 and Online Gambling Sites Take Notice Written by: Published on: Jan/02/2017 \nThe anonymous digital currency Bitcoin continues to grow in popularity and this is certainly reflected in a strong start to 2017 with trading breaking the $1000 mark Monday for the first time in three years. \nOn Monday morning, the cryptocurrency was trading at $1021 and seemingly rising. \n\"We are seeing the aftermath of zero interest rates run amok. So Bitcoin is a healthy reminder that we don't have to hold on to dollars or renminbi, which is subject to capital controls and loss of purchasing power. Rather it's a new asset class,\" Bobby Lee, chief executive of BTC China, one of the world's largest bitcoin exchanges, told CNBC by phone. \nMost, if not all, online gambling sites had added Bitcoin by 2016. \nWeb gambling companies the likes of AceSportsbook.com have claimed Bitcoin accounts for over a quarter of its overall processing. \n- Aaron Goldstein, Gambling911.com",

      "text": "Canada's opening stance for NAFTA talks: Common ground, not confrontation The Canadian Press   10:00am Last Updated January 2, 2017 - 10:34am \nWASHINGTON — The Canadian government is signalling the approach it intends to take should Donald Trump make good on his promise to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement. \nCanada's ambassador to the U.S. is laying out some starting principles such as co-operation instead of confrontation. \nIn a lengthy interview, David MacNaughton expressed his desire to see the countries propose common-ground, common-sense ideas that improve the old agreement instead of flinging out hardball demands that could produce deep, drama-filled bargaining. \n\"We have done an extensive amount of work (to prepare for this),\" MacNaughton said in the year-end interview. \"We have a good sense of what would be in Canada's interest.... \n\"(But) the areas we need to focus on — and I think we are focusing on — is where is it not just in Canada's interest, but in Canada and the United States' interest... \n\"I think if we're just blatantly trying to push something that works for us but doesn't work for them, that's not going to be... quite as easy.\" \nThere's already enough potential for trade tussles with the incoming Trump administration. \nThey include the incoming president's vow to fight certain tax policies of other countries; his preference for Buy American restrictions on infrastructure projects; the ongoing softwood lumber dispute; and increasing anger from U.S. dairy producers over Canadian import restrictions. \nAware of the irritants that could erupt in 2017, the Canadian government has already begun reaching out to potential U.S. allies to bolster its public advocacy on some of these issues including Buy American. \nBut the government wants to avoid having irritants inject uncertainty into discussions about the trade treaty that governs the region where Canada sells more than three-quarters of its exports. \nMacNaughton wouldn't elaborate on the specific improvements he has in mind, saying he wants to avoid negotiating in public. \nHe did confirm one potential change: to professional visas. \nInternational businesses have complained about an out-of-date visa system that creates unnecessary red tape when employees travel across the border for work. When asked about visas, MacNaughton confirmed that was the type of mutually beneficial upgrade he favours. \nIt's also unclear what the incoming administration actually wants from Canada — Trump almost never mentioned the northern neighbour during the campaign, even as he railed against NAFTA. \nMacNaughton said he's received some encouraging signals about its attitude toward Canada. \nHe said he's had positive conversations with people close to Trump, including his pick for attorney-general, Jeff Sessions, and incoming White House chief of staff Reince Priebus, who attended a White House correspondents' dinner party at the Canadian embassy. \nThe Trump team's complaints about trade tend to involve currency manipulation, dumping of steel, cheap labour, trade imbalances, and low environmental standards that make it hard for U.S. companies to compete. \n\"None of those things apply to Canada,\" MacNaughton said. \n\"I think they see us as pretty much the good guys, rather than the bad guys in terms of trade.\" \nThis raises a question about the other North American amigo: Mexico, which has been a frequent target of Trump's. That question is, would Canada seek to renegotiate NAFTA as a trilateral block, or cut Mexico loose and try getting a better result by dealing one-on-one with the Americans? \nMacNaughton said he couldn't rule out either possibility: \"The reality is that we will do what is in Canada's interest,\" he said. \"(But) we don't have exclusive control over whether or not the Americans want to have trilateral conversations or bilateral conversations.\" \nAs for the upcoming irritants, the Canadians have begun a pre-emptive pushback. \nThey've been warning American interlocutors about potential damage should Canada be included in two of Trump's campaign policies: Buy American infrastructure restrictions, and tax changes Trump's team wants included in trade deals. \nOn Buy American, MacNaughton says his team has been talking to the United Steelworkers union which has members in both countries, and whose president is Canadian Leo Gerard, in the hope of getting an exemption for Canadian steel — like the one eventually worked out between Stephen Harper and Barack Obama following the 2009 U.S. stimulus bill. \nThey've warned Americans they've talked to that penalizing Canadian steel might threaten co-operation in international forums, where Canada and the U.S. work together to fight product dumping. \n\"They can't put up barriers to importation of steel in the United States and expect us to be working with them, hand in glove, to prevent abuses from third countries. So we've made that point.\" \nOn taxes, Trump's platform accused foreign countries of using value-added taxes as a backdoor tariff on American-based companies, offering export rebates that render the U.S. firms less competitive and entice them to move offshore. \nMacNaughton says the government has already begun warning Americans that conversation risks a slippery slope. He said anything that would increase taxes on Canadian exports would be worrisome, and would hurt U.S. consumers. \n\"I think the thing that we've pointed out to any of them when we've talked about this is, 'I'm not sure that you want to put an import tax on energy.' I'm not sure U.S. consumers would think very highly of that; same for products that go back and forth across the border more than once. I'm not sure you want to tax that.\" \nSo what does he want to see from the next U.S. administration? \nMacNaughton goes right back to the original point: \"Make NAFTA work better, rather than throw out the baby with the bathwater.\" \nAlexander Panetta, The Canadian Press",

      "text": "Stocks start 2017 with gains, but many markets stay shut The Canadian Press   7:44am Last Updated January 2, 2017 - 8:14am \nLONDON — Global stocks rose on the first day of 2017, though trading volumes were thin as many major markets observed New Year's holidays. \nKEEPING SCORE: Germany's DAX was up 0.9 per cent at 11,580 and France's CAC 40 was 0.4 per cent higher at 4,881. Britain's FTSE 100, which closed at a record high on Friday, remained closed. \nUPBEAT DATA: Markets were buoyed by a report showing the manufacturing sector in the 19-country eurozone grew at the fastest rate in 68 months in December. The so-called purchasing managers' index rose to 54.9 points from 53.7 points in November. Also helping sentiment was a report published Sunday showing that China's manufacturing sector continued to expand in December, though at a slightly slower pace than the month before. \nANALYST TAKE: \"While the eurozone seems to have ended 2016 on the up in economic terms, we are concerned that GDP growth could be increasingly hampered in 2017 by political uncertainties,\" said Howard Archer, global economist at IHS Markit. Those uncertainties include Britain's formal start to talks to leave the European Union and elections in France and the Netherlands, where far right parties that favour leaving the euro are expected to do well. \nHOLIDAY IMPACT: Trading was slow as many markets were closed to observe the New Year's holiday. Besides Britain, markets were closed in Japan, China and Hong Kong and were due to remain shut in New York. Of those that did trade in Asia, India's Sensex ended the day 0.1 per cent lower at 26,595.45 while South Korea's KOSPI was flat at 2,026.16. \nCURRENCIES: The dollar started the new year with broad gains in currency markets. It was at 117.30 yen, up from 117.00 the previous day. The euro was trading at $1.0481, from $1.0443. \nTrading in several commodities, including crude oil, was closed on Monday. \nThe Associated Press",

Stocks start 2017 with gains, but many markets stay shut 0 comments \nLONDON - Global stocks rose on the first day of 2017, though trading volumes were thin as many major markets observed New Year's holidays. \nKEEPING SCORE: Germany's DAX was up 0.8 per cent at 11,574 and France's CAC 40 was 0.4 per cent higher at 4,883. Italy's FTSE MIB was up 1.5 per cent at 18,520, though trading was still suspended in the shares of Monte dei Paschi di Siena, the bank that is due to get a government bailout. Britain's FTSE 100, which closed at a record high on Friday, remained closed. \nUPBEAT DATA: Markets were buoyed by a report showing the manufacturing sector in the 19-country eurozone grew at the fastest rate in 68 months in December. The so-called purchasing managers' index rose to 54.9 points from 53.7 points in November. Also helping sentiment was a report published Sunday showing that China's manufacturing sector continued to expand in December, though at a slightly slower pace than the month before. \nANALYST TAKE: \"While the eurozone seems to have ended 2016 on the up in economic terms, we are concerned that GDP growth could be increasingly hampered in 2017 by political uncertainties,\" said Howard Archer, global economist at IHS Markit. Those uncertainties include Britain's formal start to talks to leave the European Union and elections in France and the Netherlands, where far right parties that favour leaving the euro are expected to do well. \nHOLIDAY IMPACT: Trading was slow as many markets were closed to observe the New Year's holiday. Besides Britain, markets were closed in Japan, China and Hong Kong and were due to remain shut in New York. Of those that did trade in Asia, India's Sensex ended the day 0.1 per cent lower at 26,595.45 while South Korea's KOSPI was flat at 2,026.16. \nCURRENCIES: The dollar started the new year with broad gains in currency markets. It was at 117.30 yen, up from 117.00 the previous day. The euro was trading at $1.0477, from $1.0443. \nTrading in several commodities, including crude oil, was closed on Monday.",

Sekhar Reddy and lawyer Rohit Tandon into new currency. \nAdditional Sessions Judge Raj Kumar Tripathi sent Lodha to 14 days judicial custody after Enforcement Directorate told court that he is not required for further custodial interrogation. \nLodha was presented before the court after expiry of his four day ED custody. Meanwhile, as Lodha's defence counsel Rebecca John moved the bail plea, the court has asked ED to file its reply on the plea and listed the matter for January 6. The Kolkata-based businessman was arrested on December 21, after hours of questioning by the ED officials and booked under the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). Lodha, a leading businessman with interests in real estate and mining, had been intercepted by a team of ED sleuths at the Mumbai airport while he was trying to flee to Malaysia. \nThe Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) had last month arrested Reddy, a former Tirumala Tirupathi Devasthanam Board Member, and two others from Chennai for money-laundering after Income Tax (IT) department recently seized 177 kg of gold, Rs 96 crore in old 500 and 1,000 rupee notes and Rs 34 crore in new currency from their premises. Cash amount of Rs 13.65 crore, including Rs 2.60 crore in new currency notes, was seized from the office of Tandon in south Delhi's Greater Kailash-I area during a raid conducted by Delhi Police on December 10. Sources said that Reddy had executed a lot of work for the Tamil Nadu government. In connection with the case, IT officials raided 12 locations in the southern state including the house of Tamil Nadu Chief Secretary P. Rama Mohana Rao. ED officials on December 1 raided multiple hawala operators across the country involved in illegal conversion of old currency notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 to valid legal tender since November 8 demonetisation announcement loading...",

      "text": "Advertisement Canada seeking common ground, not confrontation as NAFTA talks open \nCanada's Ambassador to the United States David MacNaughton attends a business luncheon in Montreal, Wednesday, November 16, 2016. (Graham Hughes / THE CANADIAN PRESS) Alexander Panetta, The Canadian   9:20AM EST \nWASHINGTON -- The Canadian government is signalling the approach it intends to take should Donald Trump make good on his promise to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement. \nCanada's ambassador to the U.S. is laying out some starting principles such as co-operation instead of confrontation. \nIn a lengthy interview, David MacNaughton expressed his desire to see the countries propose common-ground, common-sense ideas that improve the old agreement instead of flinging out hardball demands that could produce deep, drama-filled bargaining. \n\"We have done an extensive amount of work (to prepare for this),\" MacNaughton said in the year-end interview. \"We have a good sense of what would be in Canada's interest.... \n\"(But) the areas we need to focus on -- and I think we are focusing on -- is where is it not just in Canada's interest, but in Canada and the United States' interest... \n\"I think if we're just blatantly trying to push something that works for us but doesn't work for them, that's not going to be... quite as easy.\" \nThere's already enough potential for trade tussles with the incoming Trump administration. \nThey include the incoming president's vow to fight certain tax policies of other countries; his preference for Buy American restrictions on infrastructure projects; the ongoing softwood lumber dispute; and increasing anger from U.S. dairy producers over Canadian import restrictions. \nAware of the irritants that could erupt in 2017, the Canadian government has already begun reaching out to potential U.S. allies to bolster its public advocacy on some of these issues including Buy American. \nBut the government wants to avoid having irritants inject uncertainty into discussions about the trade treaty that governs the region where Canada sells more than three-quarters of its exports. \nMacNaughton wouldn't elaborate on the specific improvements he has in mind, saying he wants to avoid negotiating in public. \nHe did confirm one potential change: to professional visas. \nInternational businesses have complained about an out-of-date visa system that creates unnecessary red tape when employees travel across the border for work. When asked about visas, MacNaughton confirmed that was the type of mutually beneficial upgrade he favours. \nIt's also unclear what the incoming administration actually wants from Canada -- Trump almost never mentioned the northern neighbour during the campaign, even as he railed against NAFTA. \nMacNaughton said he's received some encouraging signals about its attitude toward Canada. \nHe said he's had positive conversations with people close to Trump, including his pick for attorney-general, Jeff Sessions, and incoming White House chief of staff Reince Priebus, who attended a White House correspondents' dinner party at the Canadian embassy. \nThe Trump team's complaints about trade tend to involve currency manipulation, dumping of steel, cheap labour, trade imbalances, and low environmental standards that make it hard for U.S. companies to compete. \n\"None of those things apply to Canada,\" MacNaughton said. \n\"I think they see us as pretty much the good guys, rather than the bad guys in terms of trade.\" \nThis raises a question about the other North American amigo: Mexico, which has been a frequent target of Trump's. That question is, would Canada seek to renegotiate NAFTA as a trilateral block, or cut Mexico loose and try getting a better result by dealing one-on-one with the Americans? \nMacNaughton said he couldn't rule out either possibility: \"The reality is that we will do what is in Canada's interest,\" he said. \"(But) we don't have exclusive control over whether or not the Americans want to have trilateral conversations or bilateral conversations.\" \nAs for the upcoming irritants, the Canadians have begun a pre-emptive pushback. \nThey've been warning American interlocutors about potential damage should Canada be included in two of Trump's campaign policies: Buy American infrastructure restrictions, and tax changes Trump's team wants included in trade deals. \nOn Buy American, MacNaughton says his team has been talking to the United Steelworkers union which has members in both countries, and whose president is Canadian Leo Gerard, in the hope of getting an exemption for Canadian steel -- like the one eventually worked out between Stephen Harper and Barack Obama following the 2009 U.S. stimulus bill. \nThey've warned Americans they've talked to that penalizing Canadian steel might threaten co-operation in international forums, where Canada and the U.S. work together to fight product dumping. \n\"They can't put up barriers to importation of steel in the United States and expect us to be working with them, hand in glove, to prevent abuses from third countries. So we've made that point.\" \nOn taxes, Trump's platform accused foreign countries of using value-added taxes as a backdoor tariff on American-based companies, offering export rebates that render the U.S. firms less competitive and entice them to move offshore. \nMacNaughton says the government has already begun warning Americans that conversation risks a slippery slope. He said anything that would increase taxes on Canadian exports would be worrisome, and would hurt U.S. consumers. \n\"I think the thing that we've pointed out to any of them when we've talked about this is, 'I'm not sure that you want to put an import tax on energy.' I'm not sure U.S. consumers would think very highly of that; same for products that go back and forth across the border more than once. I'm not sure you want to tax that.\" \nSo what does he want to see from the next U.S. administration? \nMacNaughton goes right back to the original point: \"Make NAFTA work better, rather than throw out the baby with the bathwater.\" Related Stories",

To submit a letter by e-mail, click here: letters@globeandmail.com \n\nBecause it’s 2017: A prediction \nA safe New Year’s prediction: Donald Trump will make America grate again.\nColin Read, London, Ont. \n\nBecause it’s 2017: Mideast diplomacy \nThe convoluted language of diplomacy in the Mideast file is going by the wayside. Plain talk, for at least a few moments as we enter 2017, is the common currency of communication. So here are a few blunt truths:\n1) The peace process is moribund;\n2) There is no effective representative Palestinian leadership to engage in negotiations;\n3) Israel has virtually solved the problem of suicide bombers, and has no incentive to negotiate land for peace;\n4) As a result, bilateral negotiations between Palestinians and Israel are impossible;\n5) Without an internationally mandated intervention to conduct multilateral negotiations, there will be no viable Palestinian state.\nWhy so? To vary what has be-come an adage: Because it’s 2017.\nHoward Greenfield, Montreal \n\nRe Ignore The Noise: Resolution 2334 Has Global Support (Dec. 30): Paul Heinbecker asks, “If the United States were to walk away from the UN, as some suggest, who would shield Israel then?”\nThe U.S. will never abandon Israel because of the strong lobby group it has there. As proof, witness the $10-billion military aid package to be given to Israel over the next 10 years, as noted in your editorial (Cutting Off The Only Path To Real Peace – Dec. 30).\nThere is no significant incentive for Israel to compromise and give up the settlements when it has that kind of U.S. military support. Imagine the unimaginable for a moment and a different U.S. tactic – there will be no $10-billion military aid as long as there are more settlements. Instead, the United States abstained from voting on Resolution 2334.\nDavid Enns, Cornwall, Ont. \n\nIsraeli prime ministers Ehud Barak and Ehud Olmert each negotiated with the Palestinian leadership and offered them statehood. The offers involved concessions on settlements, including dismantling many of them. And both of those prime ministers oversaw more new settlement construction than has occurred under Benjamin Netanyahu. Yet you say settlement construction undermines the peace process and stands to make a two-state deal impossible. Israeli settlement construction hinders the peace process only because the Palestinian Authority uses it as an excuse not to come to the table. Resolution 2334 significantly bolsters that excuse and will serve the PA well in its efforts to avoid accepting a state for its long-suffering people.\nDaniel Fogel, Toronto \n\nObjecting to the building of settlements in the West Bank is all very well but one has to accept reality. As long as Israel is flanked by states that deny its right to exist there is absolutely no possibility of a two-state solution.\nPassivity to threats had disastrous consequences for the Jewish people and there is no way they are going to follow that path again, regardless of the “rights” or “wrongs” of their action.\nD.J. Lloyd, Kingston \n\nBecause it’s 2017: Canada and arms \nIn 2017, Canada will finally join the UN Arms Trade Treaty, and Canadians must put pressure on the government to ensure that this translates into real change in the weapons trade. The tragedy in Syria is fuelled by a constant supply of arms from the West; Canada is the second-largest exporter of arms to the Middle East. This shames me as a Canadian.\nThe West has been criticized for its “collective inaction” in Syria, but I would argue that the West has been very active, and that we urgently need to consider how our actions in the business-as-usual model of capitalism have contributed to this tragedy.\nThe arms trade is one of two big areas where short-term, narrow financial interests have trumped social and environmental responsibility and contributed to a cycle of war. Climate change is the other. Both are areas where Canada has acted wrongly, and where by righting our actions we can make a real peace-building difference. Severe ongoing drought exacerbated by climate change significantly contributed to the food shortages that precipitated the war in Syria. Now, the UN is predicting that south Sudan is soon to become uninhabitable due to climate change, and many other regions are at similar risk.\nCanada needs to keep its climate commitments, keep the fossil fuels in the ground, and meet our promised funding for climate-change mitigation in vulnerable regions. We need to do everything we can to be a world leader in climate justice, to stop prioritizing blind economic growth over the well-being of people, planet, and peace.\nThis is how we can truly help the people of Syria.\nRebecca Weigand, Toronto \n\nBecause it’s 2017: A health accord \nIf the provinces want to improve access to care and reduce pressures on hospitals, they need to in-vest in mental health. Now. Provinces that haven’t reached a deal with Ottawa, and that includes Ontario, should accept the federal offer on mental-health and home-care funding and continue to discuss the size of health transfers with the federal government.\nThe mental-health and home-care investments will increase capacity to provide services in people’s homes and the community while reducing pressure on hospital services, a major driver of increased health care costs.\nUnder the last accord, the provinces failed to make needed investments in mental-health services. For example, between 2004 and 2011, Ontario invested $16.45 per capita in mental health services, while putting $1,361 per capita into other areas of health care. Compare that to Australia, which invested $98.13 in mental-health services, New Zealand’s $198 and the U.K, which invested $62.22. Provinces aren’t meeting the 2012 health spending targets of 9 per cent recommended by the Mental Health Commission.\nOntario’s mental-health share of health spending is some 6 per cent, Saskatchewan’s is 5 per cent. Without more funds, wait lists and wait times will keep growing.\nIn Ontario, young people are waiting up to 18 months for mental-health assessments and services, in Toronto, 2,000 people are waiting up to a year to access community mental-health services. The wait list for supportive housing has over 12,000 names, with wait times of up to seven years.\nSteve Lurie, executive director, CMHA Toronto \n\nBecause it’s 2017: Canada’s envoy? \nWith Donald Trump about to take over in Washington on Jan. 20, we should have an ambassador there who can match his forceful manner, colourful personality, total freedom from any excessive modesty – and ideally have some show business experience.\nSuch individuals are rare, but I think we are lucky in having one person who would fully meet all those exacting requirements: Don Cherry.\nAndrzej Derkowski, Oakville, Ont.",

      "text": "Stocks start 2017 with gains, but many markets stay shut Jan 2, 2017 tweet \nLONDON (AP) — Global stocks rose on the first day of 2017, though trading volumes were thin as many major markets observed New Year’s holidays. \nKEEPING SCORE: Germany’s DAX was up 0.8 percent at 11,574 and France’s CAC 40 was 0.4 percent higher at 4,883. Italy’s FTSE MIB was up 1.5 percent at 18,520, though trading was still suspended in the shares of Monte dei Paschi di Siena, the bank that is due to get a government bailout. Britain’s FTSE 100, which closed at a record high on Friday, remained closed. \nUPBEAT DATA: Markets were buoyed by a report showing the manufacturing sector in the 19-country eurozone grew at the fastest rate in 68 months in December. The so-called purchasing managers’ index rose to 54.9 points from 53.7 points in November. Also helping sentiment was a report published Sunday showing that China’s manufacturing sector continued to expand in December, though at a slightly slower pace than the month before. \nANALYST TAKE: “While the eurozone seems to have ended 2016 on the up in economic terms, we are concerned that GDP growth could be increasingly hampered in 2017 by political uncertainties,” said Howard Archer, global economist at IHS Markit. Those uncertainties include Britain’s formal start to talks to leave the European Union and elections in France and the Netherlands, where far right parties that favor leaving the euro are expected to do well. \nHOLIDAY IMPACT: Trading was slow as many markets were closed to observe the New Year’s holiday. Besides Britain, markets were closed in Japan, China and Hong Kong and were due to remain shut in New York. Of those that did trade in Asia, India’s Sensex ended the day 0.1 percent lower at 26,595.45 while South Korea’s KOSPI was flat at 2,026.16. \nCURRENCIES: The dollar started the new year with broad gains in currency markets. It was at 117.30 yen, up from 117.00 the previous day. The euro was trading at $1.0477, from $1.0443. \nTrading in several commodities, including crude oil, was closed on Monday. SHARE",

      "text": "News / Canada Common ground, not confrontation, Canada's plan for NAFTA talks Canada's ambassador to the U.S. expressed his desire to see the two countries propose common-ground, common-sense ideas that approve the old agreement. Share on Facebook Print The Canadian Press Canada's Ambassador to the Unitied States David MacNaughton attends a business luncheon in Montreal in a November 16, 2016, file photo. By: Alexander Panetta The Canadian Press Published on WASHINGTON — The Canadian government is signalling the approach it intends to take should Donald Trump make good on his promise to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement. Canada's ambassador to the U.S. is laying out some starting principles such as co-operation instead of confrontation. In a lengthy interview, David MacNaughton expressed his desire to see the countries propose common-ground, common-sense ideas that improve the old agreement instead of flinging out hardball demands that could produce deep, drama-filled bargaining. \"We have done an extensive amount of work (to prepare for this),\" MacNaughton said in the year-end interview. \"We have a good sense of what would be in Canada's interest.... \"(But) the areas we need to focus on — and I think we are focusing on — is where is it not just in Canada's interest, but in Canada and the United States' interest... \"I think if we're just blatantly trying to push something that works for us but doesn't work for them, that's not going to be... quite as easy.\" There's already enough potential for trade tussles with the incoming Trump administration. They include the incoming president's vow to fight certain tax policies of other countries; his preference for Buy American restrictions on infrastructure projects; the ongoing softwood lumber dispute; and increasing anger from U.S. dairy producers over Canadian import restrictions. Aware of the irritants that could erupt in 2017, the Canadian government has already begun reaching out to potential U.S. allies to bolster its public advocacy on some of these issues including Buy American. But the government wants to avoid having irritants inject uncertainty into discussions about the trade treaty that governs the region where Canada sells more than three-quarters of its exports. MacNaughton wouldn't elaborate on the specific improvements he has in mind, saying he wants to avoid negotiating in public. He did confirm one potential change: to professional visas. International businesses have complained about an out-of-date visa system that creates unnecessary red tape when employees travel across the border for work. When asked about visas, MacNaughton confirmed that was the type of mutually beneficial upgrade he favours. It's also unclear what the incoming administration actually wants from Canada — Trump almost never mentioned the northern neighbour during the campaign, even as he railed against NAFTA. MacNaughton said he's received some encouraging signals about its attitude toward Canada. He said he's had positive conversations with people close to Trump, including his pick for attorney-general, Jeff Sessions, and incoming White House chief of staff Reince Priebus, who attended a White House correspondents' dinner party at the Canadian embassy. The Trump team's complaints about trade tend to involve currency manipulation, dumping of steel, cheap labour, trade imbalances, and low environmental standards that make it hard for U.S. companies to compete. \"None of those things apply to Canada,\" MacNaughton said. \"I think they see us as pretty much the good guys, rather than the bad guys in terms of trade.\" This raises a question about the other North American amigo: Mexico, which has been a frequent target of Trump's. That question is, would Canada seek to renegotiate NAFTA as a trilateral block, or cut Mexico loose and try getting a better result by dealing one-on-one with the Americans? MacNaughton said he couldn't rule out either possibility: \"The reality is that we will do what is in Canada's interest,\" he said. \"(But) we don't have exclusive control over whether or not the Americans want to have trilateral conversations or bilateral conversations.\" As for the upcoming irritants, the Canadians have begun a pre-emptive pushback. They've been warning American interlocutors about potential damage should Canada be included in two of Trump's campaign policies: Buy American infrastructure restrictions, and tax changes Trump's team wants included in trade deals. On Buy American, MacNaughton says his team has been talking to the United Steelworkers union which has members in both countries, and whose president is Canadian Leo Gerard, in the hope of getting an exemption for Canadian steel — like the one eventually worked out between Stephen Harper and Barack Obama following the 2009 U.S. stimulus bill. They've warned Americans they've talked to that penalizing Canadian steel might threaten co-operation in international forums, where Canada and the U.S. work together to fight product dumping. \"They can't put up barriers to importation of steel in the United States and expect us to be working with them, hand in glove, to prevent abuses from third countries. So we've made that point.\" On taxes, Trump's platform accused foreign countries of using value-added taxes as a backdoor tariff on American-based companies, offering export rebates that render the U.S. firms less competitive and entice them to move offshore. MacNaughton says the government has already begun warning Americans that conversation risks a slippery slope. He said anything that would increase taxes on Canadian exports would be worrisome, and would hurt U.S. consumers. \"I think the thing that we've pointed out to any of them when we've talked about this is, 'I'm not sure that you want to put an import tax on energy.' I'm not sure U.S. consumers would think very highly of that; same for products that go back and forth across the border more than once. I'm not sure you want to tax that.\" So what does he want to see from the next U.S. administration? MacNaughton goes right back to the original point: \"Make NAFTA work better, rather than throw out the baby with the bathwater.\" Editors' Picks",

      "text": "Open Build a mlm donation platform This project is ending in 6 days and has an average bid price of $626 USD . Project Description \nAnalysis phase : \nThe project is being analyzed as a social app for people to raise money for themselves (Exactly an MLM community). \nSignup page contains field informations including 3 countries where people can choose their country so as use their local currency, or else use bitcoin. \nThe 3 countries are Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa. \nBitcoin will be for all countries as a wallet money. \nSystem will match randomly two people as ids and they will send money to you. \nSuper admin and other admins will be the first users on the system, and we will pay to each other. \nAbility to restart the whole program at the touch of a button should wipe the database so people can all start afresh. \nDesigning & Development Phase : \nA home page before signup and login. \nSignup page where user could get registred and fill bank account details. \nLogin page to authenticate user to start playing . \nDashboard page after login. \nWorking page . How it works… like(a static informative page) \nWallet page where user can see its profile and wallet money. \nProfile management \nThis system provides the user to maintain their friend list and user can update their friend list. \nThe system should have option to cross-match people based on who comes first, or who is ripe to receive payment. \nIts an automatic and matches people who do not know each other or register via same upline. \nHere in this app you wanna do, there won’t be need for compulsory referrals. But whoever refers someone should always get a referral bonus of (10% each time) the referred person makes payment. \nAbility to restart the whole program at the touch of a button should wipe the database so people can all start afresh. \nWhen a user needs to reach support, there should be support button from the app, so he can type his issue and admin replies from admin dashboard and he picks his reply there too. \nPayment orders should be assigned every day. Like if I join today, Im matched to pay today, and tomorrow someone will be matched to pay me, and same for the next three days too. \nThere is timer on app: 30 hours for sender to pay, and after he makes payment, he uploads proof of payment to receiver. Once proof of payment is uploaded, receiver has 24hours to confirm. If the sender uploads a proof of payment but do not make payment, the receiver can click- \"I do not receive payment\" which flags the transaction as dispute. ASdmin can view dispute from his dashboard, and ask both sender to submit his proof of payment on the disputed order, and receiver too submit bank statement for said order so as to know who is faulty. Admin can suspend and block user. Any user who refuse to pay or upload POP (Proof of payment) before expiry is suspended. Any user whogets payment but do not click CONFIRMATION, should get suspended too. \nSUSPENDED PAGE \nAny one who defaults and admin blocks from the system is blocked from the system forever. \nGive room for admin, to levy a fee of a certain amount on a particular user, or a particular stage or level orability to select all level and all stages please. \nReferral page",

      "text": "On NAFTA, Canada seeks common ground, not confrontation \nCanada’s ambassador to the U.S. prepares to deal with Donald Trump on NAFTA (Stephen Crowley/The New York Times/Redux) WASHINGTON — The Canadian government is signalling the approach it intends to take should Donald Trump make good on his promise to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement. Canada’s ambassador to the U.S. is laying out some starting principles such as co-operation instead of confrontation. In a lengthy interview, David MacNaughton expressed his desire to see the countries propose common-ground, common-sense ideas that improve the old agreement instead of flinging out hardball demands that could produce deep, drama-filled bargaining. “We have done an extensive amount of work (to prepare for this),” MacNaughton said in the year-end interview. “We have a good sense of what would be in Canada’s interest…. “(But) the areas we need to focus on — and I think we are focusing on — is where is it not just in Canada’s interest, but in Canada and the United States’ interest… “I think if we’re just blatantly trying to push something that works for us but doesn’t work for them, that’s not going to be… quite as easy.” There’s already enough potential for trade tussles with the incoming Trump administration. They include the incoming president’s vow to fight certain tax policies of other countries; his preference for Buy American restrictions on infrastructure projects; the ongoing softwood lumber dispute; and increasing anger from U.S. dairy producers over Canadian import restrictions. Aware of the irritants that could erupt in 2017, the Canadian government has already begun reaching out to potential U.S. allies to bolster its public advocacy on some of these issues including Buy American. But the government wants to avoid having irritants inject uncertainty into discussions about the trade treaty that governs the region where Canada sells more than three-quarters of its exports. MacNaughton wouldn’t elaborate on the specific improvements he has in mind, saying he wants to avoid negotiating in public. He did confirm one potential change: to professional visas. International businesses have complained about an out-of-date visa system that creates unnecessary red tape when employees travel across the border for work. When asked about visas, MacNaughton confirmed that was the type of mutually beneficial upgrade he favours. It’s also unclear what the incoming administration actually wants from Canada — Trump almost never mentioned the northern neighbour during the campaign, even as he railed against NAFTA. MacNaughton said he’s received some encouraging signals about its attitude toward Canada. He said he’s had positive conversations with people close to Trump, including his pick for attorney-general, Jeff Sessions, and incoming White House chief of staff Reince Priebus, who attended a White House correspondents’ dinner party at the Canadian embassy. The Trump team’s complaints about trade tend to involve currency manipulation, dumping of steel, cheap labour, trade imbalances, and low environmental standards that make it hard for U.S. companies to compete. “None of those things apply to Canada,” MacNaughton said. “I think they see us as pretty much the good guys, rather than the bad guys in terms of trade.” This raises a question about the other North American amigo: Mexico, which has been a frequent target of Trump’s. That question is, would Canada seek to renegotiate NAFTA as a trilateral block, or cut Mexico loose and try getting a better result by dealing one-on-one with the Americans? MacNaughton said he couldn’t rule out either possibility: “The reality is that we will do what is in Canada’s interest,” he said. “(But) we don’t have exclusive control over whether or not the Americans want to have trilateral conversations or bilateral conversations.” As for the upcoming irritants, the Canadians have begun a pre-emptive pushback. They’ve been warning American interlocutors about potential damage should Canada be included in two of Trump’s campaign policies: Buy American infrastructure restrictions, and tax changes Trump’s team wants included in trade deals. On Buy American, MacNaughton says his team has been talking to the United Steelworkers union which has members in both countries, and whose president is Canadian Leo Gerard, in the hope of getting an exemption for Canadian steel — like the one eventually worked out between Stephen Harper and Barack Obama following the 2009 U.S. stimulus bill. They’ve warned Americans they’ve talked to that penalizing Canadian steel might threaten co-operation in international forums, where Canada and the U.S. work together to fight product dumping. “They can’t put up barriers to importation of steel in the United States and expect us to be working with them, hand in glove, to prevent abuses from third countries. So we’ve made that point.” On taxes, Trump’s platform accused foreign countries of using value-added taxes as a backdoor tariff on American-based companies, offering export rebates that render the U.S. firms less competitive and entice them to move offshore. MacNaughton says the government has already begun warning Americans that conversation risks a slippery slope. He said anything that would increase taxes on Canadian exports would be worrisome, and would hurt U.S. consumers. “I think the thing that we’ve pointed out to any of them when we’ve talked about this is, ‘I’m not sure that you want to put an import tax on energy.’ I’m not sure U.S. consumers would think very highly of that; same for products that go back and forth across the border more than once. I’m not sure you want to tax that.” So what does he want to see from the next U.S. administration? MacNaughton goes right back to the original point: “Make NAFTA work better, rather than throw out the baby with the bathwater.”",

      "text": "January 2, 2017 How Zimbabwe can revive industry and end its cash crisis \nBinga South Member of Parliament Gabbuza Joel Gabbuza says the best way to revive Zimbabwe’s industry is to target the manufacturing of a few kitchen commodities because those are the major things that the country is importing. \nGovernment should then introduce an import tax of even 5 percent, like the current export incentive, because with $6 billion worth of imports every year the government can raise $300 000 which can be used to revive industry. \nGabbuza said the current export incentive would not revive industry at all because it was targeted at a few companies and commodities. \n“Firstly, we are giving incentives of 5% to the chrome industry and the gold sector, which are the only things that are there in terms of exports. If you look at a gold or chrome plant, even if you give them a 5% incentive, if the capacity of the processing plant is to produce 10 tonnes, no matter how much incentives you offer, that plant will not produce any excess, so that 5% will not result in extra production at all. The plant is built to process a certain amount of commodity or mineral output per month or per day,” he said. \n“Mr. Speaker Sir, we are also incentivising things like tobacco, which is seasonal. After we have reaped all our tobacco, what else will bring in foreign currency? It is a seasonal crop and once it is reaped and sold, it is done. Therefore, we will only earn foreign currency from tobacco over a certain period.” \nGabbuza reiterated that half of Zimbabwe’s problems could be solved by resuscitating ZISCO. \n“This is because if ZISCO Steel starts operating, automatically Hwange Colliery will start moving and the National Railways of Zimbabwe will also start operating. What will ZISCO Steel do? If it starts operating, the fertilizer price of ammonium nitrate will definitely go down because ZISCO Steel subsidises Sable Chemicals through buying oxygen. \n“The mining industry will start operating, the cost of operations will be reduced because most of the dynamites used in the industries now are being imported from such countries as China, South Africa and others, which is moving foreign currency outside the country. However, if ZISCO Steel was operational, explosives automatically follow because they are a by-product of the hydrogen produced at Sable Chemicals where Sable supports ZISCO Steel. That will be helpful to us.” \nContinued next page",

      "text": "AC Venezuela military trafficking food as country goes hungry \nIn this Nov. 1, 2016 photo, a man carries bags of recyclable material he collected at the dump in Puerto Cabello, Venezuela, the port city where the majority of the country's imported food arrives. When imported food goes bad at the port, the military tries to get rid of it quietly by burying it at dumps like this one. Residents say they've been able to recover oats, sunflower seeds, and pig feed dumped by the military this year. (AP Photo/Ariana Cubillos) Posted: Sunday, January 1, 2017 9:09 am Venezuela military trafficking food as country goes hungry Associated Press | 0 comments \nPUERTO CABELLO, Venezuela - When hunger drew tens of thousands of Venezuelans to the streets in protest last summer, President Nicolas Maduro turned to the military to manage the country's diminished food supply, putting generals in charge of everything from butter to rice. \nBut instead of fighting hunger, the military is making money from it, an Associated Press investigation shows. That's what grocer Jose Campos found when he ran out of pantry staples this year. In the middle of the night, he would travel to an illegal market run by the military to buy pallets of corn flour — at 100 times the government-set price. \n\"The military would be watching over whole bags of money,\" Campos said. \"They always had what I needed.\" \nWith much of the country on the verge of starvation and billions of dollars at stake, food trafficking has become one of the biggest businesses in Venezuela, the AP found. And from generals to foot soldiers, the military is at the heart of the graft, according to documents and interviews with more than 60 officials, business owners and workers, including five former generals. \nAs a result, food is not reaching those who most need it. \nThe U.S. government has taken notice. Prosecutors have opened investigations against senior Venezuelan officials, including members of the military, for laundering riches from food contracts through the U.S. financial system, according to four people with direct knowledge of the probes. No charges have been brought. \n\"Lately, food is a better business than drugs,\" said retired Gen. Cliver Alcala, who helped oversee Venezuela's border security. \"The military is in charge of food management now, and they're not going to just take that on without getting their cut.\" \n\"WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?\" \nAfter opposition attempts to overthrow him, the late President Hugo Chavez began handing the military control over the food industry, creating a Food Ministry in 2004. His socialist-run government nationalized farms and food processing plants, then neglected them, and domestic production dried up. Oil-exporting Venezuela became dependent on food imports, but when the price of oil collapsed in 2014, the government no longer could afford all the country needed. \nFood rationing grew so severe that Venezuelans spent all day waiting in lines. Pediatric wards filled up with underweight children, and formerly middle class adults began picking through trash bins for scraps. When people responded with violent street protests, Maduro handed the generals control over the rest of food distribution, and the country's ports. \nThe government now imports nearly all of Venezuela's food, according to Werner Gutierrez, the former dean of the agronomy school at the University of Zulia, and corruption is rampant, jacking up prices and leading to shortages. \n\"If Venezuela paid market prices, we'd be able to double our imports and easily satisfy the country's food needs,\" Gutierrez said. \"Instead, people are starving.\" \nOne South American businessman said he paid millions in kickbacks to Venezuelan officials as the hunger crisis worsened, including $8 million to people who work for the current food minister, Gen. Rodolfo Marco Torres. The businessman insisted on speaking anonymously because he did not want to acknowledge participating in corruption. \nLast July, he struggled to get Marco Torres's attention as a ship full of yellow corn waited to dock. \n\"This boat has been waiting for 20 days,\" he wrote in text messages seen by AP. \n\"What's the problem?\" responded Marco Torres. \nAlthough money was not mentioned, the businessman understood that he needed to give more in kickbacks. In the end, he told the general, the boat had to pull out because costs caused by the delay were mounting. \nBank documents from the businessman's country show that he was a big supplier, receiving at least $131 million in contracts from Venezuelan food ministers between 2012 and 2015. He explained that vendors like him can afford to pay off military officials because they build huge profit margins into what they bill the state. \nFor example, his $52 million contract for the yellow corn was drawn up to be charged at more than double the market rate at the time, suggesting a potential overpayment of more than $20 million for that deal alone. \nThe Food Ministry's annual report shows significant overpayments across the board, compared to market prices. And the prices the government pays for imported foods have been increasing in recent years, while global food prices remain stable. \nThis spring, the opposition-controlled congress voted to censure Marco Torres for graft. Maduro vetoed it as an attempt to hurt the Food Ministry, and Marco Torres stayed on as minister. \nInternal budgets from the ministry obtained by AP show the overpayment continues. For example, the government budgeted for $118 million of yellow corn in July at $357 a ton, which would amount to an overpayment of more than $50 million relative to prices that month. \n\"What's amazing about this is it's like a clean form of corruption,\" said Carabobo state lawmaker Neidy Rosal, who has denounced food-related government theft worth hundreds of millions of dollars. \"It's like drug trafficking you can carry out in broad daylight.\" \nMarco Torres did not respond to several requests for comment by phone, email and hand-delivered letter. In the past, he has said that he will not be trapped in fights with a bourgeoisie opposition. \n\"SCRAPING THE POT\" \nBy putting the military in charge of food, Maduro is trying to prevent soldiers from going hungry and being tempted to participate in an uprising against an increasingly unpopular government, said retired Gen. Antonio Rivero. Venezuela's military has a long history of coups against governments, and Maduro has arrested several officials for allegedly conspiring against him from within. \n\"They gave absolute control to the military,\" Rivero said from exile in Miami. \"That drained the feeling of rebellion from the armed forces, and allowed them to feed their families.\" \nHowever, it also opened the door to widespread graft and further squeezed the food supply. In large part due to concerns of corruption following the government's takeover of the food industry, the three largest global food traders — U.S.-based Archer Daniels Midland Co., Bunge Ltd. and Cargill — have stopped selling to the Venezuelan government. \nOne major scam involves the strict currency controls that have been a hallmark of the administration. The government gives out a limited amount of coveted U.S. currency at a rate of 10 bolivars to the dollar. Almost everyone else has to buy dollars on the ever more expensive black market, currently at 3,000 bolivars to the dollar. \nThe holders of licenses to import food are among the select few who get to buy dollars at the vastly cheaper rate. Alcala, the retired general, said some officials distribute these much-desired licenses to friends. The friends then use only a fraction of the dollars to import food, and share the rest with the officials. \n\"We call it 'scraping the pot,' and it's the biggest scam going in Venezuela,\" Alcala said. \nIn 2014, one general presented Maduro with a list of 300 companies suspected of simply pocketing the cheap dollars they obtained with their licenses and not importing anything. No action was ever taken and the general was forced into exile, accused of corruption himself. \nSome contracts go to companies that have no experience dealing in food or seem to exist only on paper. Financial documents obtained by AP show that Marco Torres gave Panama-registered company Atlas Systems International a $4.6 million contract to import pasta. Atlas has all the hallmarks of a shell company, including no known assets and the use of secretive shares to hide the identity of the company's true owners. Another government food supplier, J.A. Comercio de Generos Alimenticios, lists on its website a non-existent address on a narrow, partially paved street in an industrial city near Sao Paulo, Brazil. \nThe two companies transferred more than $5.5 million in U.S. dollars in 2012 and 2013 to a Geneva account controlled by two young Venezuelans, according to bank and internal company documents seen by AP. The Venezuelans were Jesus Marquina Parra and Nestor Marquina Parra, brothers-in-law of the then-food minister, Gen. Carlos Osorio. Efforts to reach the brothers were unsuccessful. \nOsorio is no longer food minister, but has an even more important role in overseeing food. He was promoted in September to inspector general of the armed forces, with the mission of ensuring transparency in the military's management of the nation's food supply. \nArturo Sanchez, a former supply chain manager at a multinational dairy company, recounted unpleasant encounters with Osorio. In one case, officers forced the company to buy fructose it didn't need because they wanted to unload merchandise he suspected was ill-gotten. Another time, he said, national guardsmen took four trucks of goods without paying. Sanchez fled to Florida in 2014. \n\"I spent a year living in the U.S. not being able to sleep remembering all the risky situations I lived through,\" he said. \nOsorio did not respond to requests for comment. But in the past he threatened to sue opposition lawmakers for staining his honour with false accusations of corruption. He blamed an economic war for the food shortages. \nThe Defence Ministry and presidential press office refused to answer repeated calls, emails and hand-delivered letters requesting comment. In the past, officials have accused the opposition of exaggerating the problem of corruption for political gain. They have said that the military's hierarchical structure makes it ideally suited to combat the real culprits: Right-wing businessmen trying to bring down the economy. \nFrom time to time, the government carries out raids of warehouses holding smuggled goods and arrests lower-ranking military officers accused of graft. For example, the night market in Carabobo state where Campos bought his corn flour was eventually shut down and 57 tons of smuggled food seized. Now Campos buys staples from intermediaries he suspects are working with the same military officials. \nIn January, the government quietly arrested 40 state employees for stealing large quantities of food from open-air markets. One of those still in jail is a colonel who had been named by Osorio to serve as president of a state agency that imported food. \n\"We have the moral fortitude and the discipline to take on this task of protecting what belongs to the people,\" the defence minister, Gen. Vladimir Padrino Lopez, said in September. \"The state has an obligation to root out corruption in all levels of public administration.\" \n\"IT'S THE CUSTOMER WHO PAYS\" \nAnd yet the corruption persists from the port to the markets, according to dozens of people working in Puerto Cabello, the town that handles the majority of Venezuela's food imports. \nSometimes the officials who control access to the docks keep ships waiting until they are paid off, said a stevedore at the port, who spoke anonymously because he feared losing his job. \nThe stevedore said clients give him envelopes of dollars to pass on to officials. He described visiting the sergeant in charge and making small talk while placing an envelope in the wastebasket. Then he slides the basket under the table and leaves. That night, his client's ships are allowed in, he said. \nAfter ships unload their cargo, customs officials take their share, according to four customs workers. They said that without a payment equivalent to a month's minimum wage, officials will not start the process of nationalizing goods. \nBribes are also required for any missing paperwork, and can exceed $10,000 for a single shipping container, customs worker Aldemar Diaz said. \n\"Sometimes you actually want to do it legally, but the officials will say, 'Don't bother,'\" he said. \nLuis Pena, operations director at the Caracas-based import business Premier Foods, said he pays off a long roster of military officials for each shipment of food he brings in from small-scale companies in the U.S. \n\"You have to pay for them to even look at your cargo now,\" he said. \"It's an unbroken chain of bribery from when your ship comes in until the food is driven out in trucks.\" \nWorst of all, he added, is that he is forced to pay to skip a health inspection. Officials make him buy a health certificate and don't even open the containers to test a sample, he said. \nA version of this process also takes place on the border, said Alcala, the retired general who was once in charge of border control. He said officers allowed smugglers to pay bribes to bring in food without proper health and safety checks. This year, Venezuelans began posting photos and videos showing magnets pulling tiny iron shavings out of freshly opened bags of sugar smuggled in from Brazil. \nPena said his contacts at the port have offered to illegally sell him government-imported staples like sugar and rice, complete with falsified papers and a military escort. \n\"The military was supposed to step in and make sure the food got to the people, but it's been the exact opposite,\" said Pena, sitting in his warehouse. \"They've made it into a business, and there's no one to appeal to. In the end, it's the customer who pays.\" \nIf he tries to get through the process without bribes, he said, the food sits and spoils. \nRotting food is a problem even as 90 per cent of Venezuelans say they can't afford enough to eat. In some cases, partners buy food that is about to expire at a steep discount, then bill the government for the full price. The government has sometimes acknowledged that food it imported arrived already expired. \nThe problem of rotting food got so bad at Puerto Cabello that it drew rebuke in the most recent state comptroller's report, which expressed particular dismay that thousands of tons of state-imported beans had been allowed to spoil. \nWhen the food is no longer usable, the military tries to get rid of it quietly. Puerto Cabello crane operator Daniel Arteaga watched one night last winter as workers at a state-run warehouse buried hundreds of containers of spoiled chicken and meat imported by the government. \n\"All these refrigerated containers, and meanwhile people are waiting in food lines each week just to buy a single chicken,\" he said. \nPhotos taken at the Puerto Cabello dump last year show men in green military fatigues helping bury beef and chicken. Residents at a slum down the hill said after the military visits the dump, they dig up animal feed, potatoes, even ham to give their children. \nThe docks are hidden behind high concrete walls, and guards watch every entrance. AP gained rare access in November. The low-ranking military members assigned to guard the port can be seen collaborating with thieves to steal what little food comes in, according to eight people who work behind the walls. \n\"You see people making off with whole sacks of flour or corn on their shoulders, and paying the guards on their way out,\" logistics co-ordinator Nicole Mendoza said. \"You see the money changing hands, and you just lower your eyes and don't say anything.\" \nLt. Miletsy Rodriguez, who is in charge of a group of national guardsmen running security at the port, said people are just looking to scapegoat the military. If her unit wasn't around, looting would be even more widespread, she said. \n\"The majority of us are doing our best. And sooner or later we'll catch people who are not doing the job right,\" she said. \nBRIBES ON THE ROAD \nJust as bribes are needed to get food into the port, they are also required to move food out, truckers said. \nThe roads near the port are lined with trucks waiting to be let in. Drivers sling hammocks in their wheel wells and sometimes wait several days in the thick tropical heat. Trucking bosses recently banded together to stop paying bribes to port officials, and the officials are now punishing them by delaying the movement of cargo onto vehicles, said Jose Petit, president of the Puerto Cabello trucking association. \nWhen the food is finally loaded onto the trucks, soldiers come by to take a cut. Photos and videos taken by truckers show officials taking sacks of sugar and coffee. As the trucks rattle off down the highway, hungry women in clothes that no longer fit chase after them to pick up anything that falls out. \nBillboards lining the highway feature a drawing of an enormous ant beside a nonworking phone number to denounce corruption, and the warning, \"No to bachaqueros.\" That's what Venezuelans call people who make a living illegally reselling food, after the leafcutter ants that haul many times their weight through the jungles. \nOn the roads, truck drivers face an obstacle course of military checkpoints, ostensibly set up to stop bachaqueros. Truckers say soldiers at about half the checkpoints demand bribes. Some invent infractions such as an insufficiently filled tire, and take cash along with sacks of pantry items, produce and even live chickens, the drivers said. \n\"It used to be you'd go your whole route and not have to pay any anything. Now at every checkpoint, they ask for 10,000 bolivars,\" said trucker Henderson Rodriguez, who was waiting for a third day to get into the port to pick up a load of sugar. \nThe surest way to move food through the network of checkpoints is to transport it under military guard. For a percentage of the product's value, military officers on the take will assign a moonlighting soldier to ride along in the truck, according to five store and restaurant owners. \nSugar and flour are among the items most in demand because they have become virtually impossible to find legally, and some businesses, like bakeries, cannot function without them. A half dozen bakery owners across the country said in interviews that military officials regularly approach them with offers to sell supplies in exchange for a bribe. \nIn the city of Valencia, bakery owner Jose Ferreira cuts two checks for each purchase of sugar: one for the official price of 2 cents a pound and one for the kickback of 60 cents of pound. He keeps copies of both checks in his books, seen by AP, in case the authorities ever come asking. \n\"You make the legal payment, and then you pay the kickback,\" he said. \"We have no other option; there's no substitute for sugar.\" \nThe theft extends to the very end of the food supply chain, vendors said. At one market in Valencia, the military members who were appointed in August to stop contraband confiscated vendors' produce. They said the vendors did not have the right permits. The food was piled in an olive green cargo truck. \nIn Puerto Cabello, hungry residents said it feels like corrupt soldiers are taking food off their children's plates. Pedro Contreras, 74, watched more than 100 trucks carrying corn rattle onto the highway, and walked stiffly into traffic to sweep up the kernels that had sifted out. He planned to pound them into corn flour that night to feed his family. \n\"The military is getting fat while my grandchildren get skinny,\" he said. \"All of Venezuela's food comes through here, but so little of it goes to us.\" \n___ \nAssociated Press writers Stan Lehman in Sao Paulo, Brazil, and Gisela Salomon in Miami contributed to this report. \n___ \nEXTRA: AP correspondent Hannah Dreier has been living through chaos this year as Venezuela edges toward collapse. This interactive collects her tweets to show daily happenings around the country. \n___ \nHannah Dreier is on Twitter at https://twitter.com/hannahdreier .

      "text": "WASHINGTON -- U.S. president-elect Donald Trump has vowed to name China a currency manipulator on his first day in the White House.\nThere's only one problem - it's not true anymore. China, the world's second-biggest economy behind the United States, hasn't been pushing down its currency to benefit Chinese exporters in years. And even if it were, the law targeting manipulators requires the U.S. spend a year negotiating a solution before it can retaliate.\nTrump spent much of the campaign blaming China for America's economic woes. And it's true that the U.S-China trade relationship is lopsided. China sells a lot more to the United States than it buys. The resulting trade deficit in goods amounted to a staggering $289 billion through the first 10 months of 2016.\nBut in fact, for the past couple of years China has been intervening in markets to prop up its currency, the yuan, not push it lower.\nIt went a step further on Thursday, watering down the significance of the dollar and adding 11 additional currencies in a foreign-exchange basket, according to a document released by the China Foreign Exchange Trading System.\nWHAT DOES CURRENCY HAVE TO DO WITH THE TRADE GAP? \nWhen China's yuan falls against the U.S. dollar, Chinese products become cheaper in the U.S. market and American products become more costly in China.\nSo the U.S. Treasury Department monitors China for signs it is manipulating the yuan lower. Treasury has guidelines for putting countries on its currency blacklist. They must, for example, have spent the equivalent of 2 per cent of their economic output over a year buying foreign currencies in an attempt to drive those currencies up and their own currencies down.\nTreasury hasn't declared China a currency manipulator since 1994.\nWHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THE US DECLARED CHINA A CURRENCY MANIPULATOR? \nProbably not much, at least initially.\nIf Treasury designates China a currency manipulator under a 2015 law, it is supposed to spend a year trying to resolve the problem through negotiations.\nShould those talks fail, the U.S. can take a number of small steps in retaliation, including stopping the U.S. Overseas Private Investment Corp., a government development agency, from financing any programs in China. Trouble is, the United States already suspended OPIC operations in China years ago -- to punish Beijing in the aftermath of the bloody 1989 crackdown in Tiananmen Square.\nSo naming China a currency manipulator is mostly \"just a jaw-boning exercise,\" said Amanda DeBusk, chair of the international trade department at the law firm of Hughes Hubbard & Reed and a former Commerce Department official. \"There's no immediate consequence.\"\nIS CHINA GUILITY OF USING CURRENCY TO HELP ITS EXPORTERS? \nFor years, China pretty clearly manipulated its currency to gain an advantage over global competitors. It bought foreign currencies, the U.S. dollar in particular, to push them higher against the yuan. As it did, it accumulated vast foreign currency reserves -- nearly $4 trillion worth by mid-2014.\nBut now the Chinese economy is slowing, and Chinese companies and individuals have begun to invest more heavily outside the country. As their money leaves China, it puts downward pressure on the yuan.\nThe yuan has dropped nearly 7 per cent against the dollar so far this year. The Chinese government has responded by draining its foreign exchange reserves to buy yuan, hoping to slow the currency's fall. China's reserves have dropped by $279 billion this year to $3.05 trillion.\nIf Beijing stepped back and let market forces determine the yuan's level, it likely would fall even faster, giving Chinese exporters even more of a competitive edge.\nSo Beijing is doing the opposite of what Trump says it's doing. Cornell University economist Eswar Prasad earlier this month called Trump's plans to name China a currency manipulator \"unmoored from reality.\"\n\"The whole discussion is ironic,\" said David Dollar, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former official at the World Bank and U.S. Treasury Department. \"It's out of date.\"\nCOULD TRUMP DO ANYTHING ON HIS OWN? \nGary Hufbauer, an expert on trade law at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, notes that as president, Trump could nonetheless escalate any dispute over the currency on his own. Over the years, Congress has ceded the president broad authority to impose trade sanctions. Trump has threatened to slap a 45 per cent tax, or tariff, on Chinese imports to punish it for unfair trade practices, including alleged currency manipulation.\nBrookings' Dollar said China likely would bring a case to the World Trade Organization \"against any protectionist measures that are a violation of U.S. commitments to the WTO,\" which oversees the rules of global commerce and rules on trade disputes.\nSome trade analysts wonder if Trump is using the tariff threat as a negotiating tool to win concessions from China.\nWhatever the U.S. motive, China has a consistent record of retaliating against trade sanctions. When the Obama administration slapped tariffs on Chinese tire imports in 2009, for instance, China lashed back by imposing a tax on U.S. chicken parts.\nChina's Global Times newspaper, published by the ruling Communist Party's People's Daily, has already speculated that \"China will take a tit-for-tat approach\" if Trump's tariffs are enacted. The paper suggested that Beijing might limit sales of Apple iPhones and Boeing jetliners in China.\n\"The Chinese are predictable and reliable,\" DeBusk said. \"If they get punched, they punch back.\"\nRelated Stories China says it will co-operate with Trump but issues warning over Taiwan Trump picks China hawk to lead new White House trade council",

      "text": "Talk Shows Canada's opening stance for NAFTA talks: Common ground, not confrontation \nCanada's Ambassador to the United States David MacNaughton speaks during a business luncheon in Montreal, Wednesday, November 16, 2016. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Graham Hughes Alexander Panetta, The Canadian Press Published Monday, January 2, 2017 9:14AM EST \nWASHINGTON -- The Canadian government is signalling the approach it intends to take should Donald Trump make good on his promise to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement. \nCanada's ambassador to the U.S. is laying out some starting principles such as co-operation instead of confrontation. \nIn a lengthy interview, David MacNaughton expressed his desire to see the countries propose common-ground, common-sense ideas that improve the old agreement instead of flinging out hardball demands that could produce deep, drama-filled bargaining. \n\"We have done an extensive amount of work (to prepare for this),\" MacNaughton said in the year-end interview. \"We have a good sense of what would be in Canada's interest.... \n\"(But) the areas we need to focus on -- and I think we are focusing on -- is where is it not just in Canada's interest, but in Canada and the United States' interest... \n\"I think if we're just blatantly trying to push something that works for us but doesn't work for them, that's not going to be... quite as easy.\" \nThere's already enough potential for trade tussles with the incoming Trump administration. \nThey include the incoming president's vow to fight certain tax policies of other countries; his preference for Buy American restrictions on infrastructure projects; the ongoing softwood lumber dispute; and increasing anger from U.S. dairy producers over Canadian import restrictions. \nAware of the irritants that could erupt in 2017, the Canadian government has already begun reaching out to potential U.S. allies to bolster its public advocacy on some of these issues including Buy American. \nBut the government wants to avoid having irritants inject uncertainty into discussions about the trade treaty that governs the region where Canada sells more than three-quarters of its exports. \nMacNaughton wouldn't elaborate on the specific improvements he has in mind, saying he wants to avoid negotiating in public. \nHe did confirm one potential change: to professional visas. \nInternational businesses have complained about an out-of-date visa system that creates unnecessary red tape when employees travel across the border for work. When asked about visas, MacNaughton confirmed that was the type of mutually beneficial upgrade he favours. \nIt's also unclear what the incoming administration actually wants from Canada -- Trump almost never mentioned the northern neighbour during the campaign, even as he railed against NAFTA. \nMacNaughton said he's received some encouraging signals about its attitude toward Canada. \nHe said he's had positive conversations with people close to Trump, including his pick for attorney-general, Jeff Sessions, and incoming White House chief of staff Reince Priebus, who attended a White House correspondents' dinner party at the Canadian embassy. \nThe Trump team's complaints about trade tend to involve currency manipulation, dumping of steel, cheap labour, trade imbalances, and low environmental standards that make it hard for U.S. companies to compete. \n\"None of those things apply to Canada,\" MacNaughton said. \n\"I think they see us as pretty much the good guys, rather than the bad guys in terms of trade.\" \nThis raises a question about the other North American amigo: Mexico, which has been a frequent target of Trump's. That question is, would Canada seek to renegotiate NAFTA as a trilateral block, or cut Mexico loose and try getting a better result by dealing one-on-one with the Americans? \nMacNaughton said he couldn't rule out either possibility: \"The reality is that we will do what is in Canada's interest,\" he said. \"(But) we don't have exclusive control over whether or not the Americans want to have trilateral conversations or bilateral conversations.\" \nAs for the upcoming irritants, the Canadians have begun a pre-emptive pushback. \nThey've been warning American interlocutors about potential damage should Canada be included in two of Trump's campaign policies: Buy American infrastructure restrictions, and tax changes Trump's team wants included in trade deals. \nOn Buy American, MacNaughton says his team has been talking to the United Steelworkers union which has members in both countries, and whose president is Canadian Leo Gerard, in the hope of getting an exemption for Canadian steel -- like the one eventually worked out between Stephen Harper and Barack Obama following the 2009 U.S. stimulus bill. \nThey've warned Americans they've talked to that penalizing Canadian steel might threaten co-operation in international forums, where Canada and the U.S. work together to fight product dumping. \n\"They can't put up barriers to importation of steel in the United States and expect us to be working with them, hand in glove, to prevent abuses from third countries. So we've made that point.\" \nOn taxes, Trump's platform accused foreign countries of using value-added taxes as a backdoor tariff on American-based companies, offering export rebates that render the U.S. firms less competitive and entice them to move offshore. \nMacNaughton says the government has already begun warning Americans that conversation risks a slippery slope. He said anything that would increase taxes on Canadian exports would be worrisome, and would hurt U.S. consumers. \n\"I think the thing that we've pointed out to any of them when we've talked about this is, 'I'm not sure that you want to put an import tax on energy.' I'm not sure U.S. consumers would think very highly of that; same for products that go back and forth across the border more than once. I'm not sure you want to tax that.\" \nSo what does he want to see from the next U.S. administration? \nMacNaughton goes right back to the original point: \"Make NAFTA work better, rather than throw out the baby with the bathwater.\"",

      "text": "Ambassador David MacNaughton Says Common Ground, Not Confrontation Needed For NAFTA Talks CP | By Alexander Panetta, The Canadian Press Posted: Comment ADVERTISEMENT \nWASHINGTON — The Canadian government is signalling the approach it intends to take should Donald Trump make good on his promise to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement. \nCanada's ambassador to the U.S. is laying out some starting principles such as co-operation instead of confrontation. \nIn a lengthy interview, David MacNaughton expressed his desire to see the countries propose common-ground, common-sense ideas that improve the old agreement instead of flinging out hardball demands that could produce deep, drama-filled bargaining. \n\"We have done an extensive amount of work (to prepare for this),'' MacNaughton said in the year-end interview. \"We have a good sense of what would be in Canada's interest.... \n\"(But) the areas we need to focus on — and I think we are focusing on — is where is it not just in Canada's interest, but in Canada and the United States' interest... \nDavid MacNaughton said he's received some encouraging signals about the Trump administration's attitude toward Canada. (Photo: CP) \n\"I think if we're just blatantly trying to push something that works for us but doesn't work for them, that's not going to be... quite as easy.'' \nThere's already enough potential for trade tussles with the incoming Trump administration. \nThey include the incoming president's vow to fight certain tax policies of other countries; his preference for Buy American restrictions on infrastructure projects; the ongoing softwood lumber dispute; and increasing anger from U.S. dairy producers over Canadian import restrictions. \nAware of the irritants that could erupt in 2017, the Canadian government has already begun reaching out to potential U.S. allies to bolster its public advocacy on some of these issues including Buy American. \nBut the government wants to avoid having irritants inject uncertainty into discussions about the trade treaty that governs the region where Canada sells more than three-quarters of its exports. \"I think they see us as pretty much the good guys, rather than the bad guys in terms of trade.'' \nMacNaughton wouldn't elaborate on the specific improvements he has in mind, saying he wants to avoid negotiating in public. \nHe did confirm one potential change: to professional visas. \nInternational businesses have complained about an out-of-date visa system that creates unnecessary red tape when employees travel across the border for work. When asked about visas, MacNaughton confirmed that was the type of mutually beneficial upgrade he favours. \nIt's also unclear what the incoming administration actually wants from Canada — Trump almost never mentioned the northern neighbour during the campaign, even as he railed against NAFTA. \nWill Mexico get cut out? \nMacNaughton said he's received some encouraging signals about its attitude toward Canada. \nHe said he's had positive conversations with people close to Trump, including his pick for attorney-general, Jeff Sessions, and incoming White House chief of staff Reince Priebus, who attended a White House correspondents' dinner party at the Canadian embassy. \nThe Trump team's complaints about trade tend to involve currency manipulation, dumping of steel, cheap labour, trade imbalances, and low environmental standards that make it hard for U.S. companies to compete. \n\"None of those things apply to Canada,'' MacNaughton said. \n\"I think they see us as pretty much the good guys, rather than the bad guys in terms of trade.'' \"The reality is that we will do what is in Canada's interest.'' \nThis raises a question about the other North American amigo: Mexico, which has been a frequent target of Trump's. That question is, would Canada seek to renegotiate NAFTA as a trilateral block, or cut Mexico loose and try getting a better result by dealing one-on-one with the Americans? \nMacNaughton said he couldn't rule out either possibility: \"The reality is that we will do what is in Canada's interest,'' he said. \"(But) we don't have exclusive control over whether or not the Americans want to have trilateral conversations or bilateral conversations.'' \nAs for the upcoming irritants, the Canadians have begun a pre-emptive pushback. \nThey've been warning American interlocutors about potential damage should Canada be included in two of Trump's campaign policies: Buy American infrastructure restrictions, and tax changes Trump's team wants included in trade deals. \nTrump's platform accused foreign countries of using value-added taxes as a backdoor tariff on American-based companies. (Photo: Reuters) \nOn Buy American, MacNaughton says his team has been talking to the United Steelworkers union which has members in both countries, and whose president is Canadian Leo Gerard, in the hope of getting an exemption for Canadian steel — like the one eventually worked out between Stephen Harper and Barack Obama following the 2009 U.S. stimulus bill. \nThey've warned Americans they've talked to that penalizing Canadian steel might threaten co-operation in international forums, where Canada and the U.S. work together to fight product dumping. \n\"They can't put up barriers to importation of steel in the United States and expect us to be working with them, hand in glove, to prevent abuses from third countries. So we've made that point.'' \nOn taxes, Trump's platform accused foreign countries of using value-added taxes as a backdoor tariff on American-based companies, offering export rebates that render the U.S. firms less competitive and entice them to move offshore. \n'Make NAFTA work better' \nMacNaughton says the government has already begun warning Americans that conversation risks a slippery slope. He said anything that would increase taxes on Canadian exports would be worrisome, and would hurt U.S. consumers. \n\"I think the thing that we've pointed out to any of them when we've talked about this is, 'I'm not sure that you want to put an import tax on energy.' I'm not sure U.S. consumers would think very highly of that; same for products that go back and forth across the border more than once. I'm not sure you want to tax that.'' \nSo what does he want to see from the next U.S. administration? \nMacNaughton goes right back to the original point: \"Make NAFTA work better, rather than throw out the baby with the bathwater.''

The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) opened at 2,022.23. (AP Photo/Lee Jin-man) By: Staff The Associated Press Published on LONDON — Global stocks rose on the first day of 2017, though trading volumes were thin as many major markets observed New Year's holidays. KEEPING SCORE: Germany's DAX closed 1 per cent higher at 11,598.33 and France's CAC 40 rose 0.4 per cent to 4,882.38. Italy's FTSE MIB gained 1.7 per cent to 19,566.53, though trading was still suspended in the shares of Monte dei Paschi di Siena, the bank that is due to get a government bailout. Britain's FTSE 100, which closed at a record high on Friday, remained closed. UPBEAT DATA: Markets were buoyed by a report showing the manufacturing sector in the 19-country eurozone grew at the fastest rate in 68 months in December. The so-called purchasing managers' index rose to 54.9 points from 53.7 points in November. Also helping sentiment was a report published Sunday showing that China's manufacturing sector continued to expand in December, though at a slightly slower pace than the month before. ANALYST TAKE: \"While the eurozone seems to have ended 2016 on the up in economic terms, we are concerned that GDP growth could be increasingly hampered in 2017 by political uncertainties,\" said Howard Archer, global economist at IHS Markit. Those uncertainties include Britain's formal start to talks to leave the European Union and elections in France and the Netherlands, where far-right parties that favour leaving the euro are expected to do well. HOLIDAY IMPACT: Trading was slow as many markets were closed to observe the New Year's holiday. Besides Britain, markets were closed in Japan, China and Hong Kong and were due to remain shut in New York. Of those that did trade in Asia, India's Sensex ended the day 0.1 per cent lower at 26,595.45 while South Korea's KOSPI was flat at 2,026.16. CURRENCIES: The dollar started the new year with broad gains in currency markets. It was at 117.46 yen, up from 117.00 the previous day. The euro was trading at $1.0476, from $1.0443. Trading in several commodities, including crude oil, was closed on Monday. Editors' Picks",

      "text": "Digital currency bitcoin kicked off the new year by jumping above $1,000 for the first time in three years late on Sunday, having outperformed all central-bank-issued currencies with a 125-per-cent climb in 2016.\nBitcoin – a web-based “cryptocurrency” that has no central authority, relying instead on thousands of computers across the world that validate transactions and add new bitcoins to the system – jumped 2.5 per cent to $1,022 on the Europe-based Bitstamp exchange, its highest since December 2013.\nThough the digital currency has historically been highly volatile – a tenfold increase in its value in two months in late 2013 took it to above $1,100, before a hack on the Tokyo-based Mt. Gox exchange saw it plunge to under $400 in the following weeks – it has in the past two years been more stable.\nIts biggest daily moves in 2016 were around 10 per cent, still very volatile compared with fiat currencies, but markedly lower than the trading of 2013, which saw daily price swings of as much as 40 per cent.\nBitcoin may have been boosted in the past year by increased demand in China on the back of a 7 per cent annual fall in the value of the yuan in 2016, the Chinese currency’s weakest showing in over 20 years. Data shows most bitcoin trading is done in China.\nBitcoin is used to move money across the globe quickly and anonymously and does not fall under the purview of any authority, making it attractive to those wanting to get around capital controls, such as China’s.\nIt is also may appeal to those worried about a lack of supply of cash, such as in India, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi removed high-denomination bank notes from circulation in November.\n“The growing war on cash, and capital controls, is making bitcoin look like a viable, if high risk, alternative,” said Paul Gordon, a board member of the UK Digital Currency Association and co-founder of Quantave, a firm seeking to make it easier for institutional investors to access digital currency exchanges.\nThough bitcoin is still some way off the all-time high of $1,163 that it reached on the Bitstamp exchange in late 2013, there are now more bitcoins in circulation – 12.5 are added to the system every 10 minutes. Its total worth is at a record-high above $16-billion, putting its value at around the same as that of an average FTSE 100 company.",

      "text": "LONDON -- Global stocks rose on the first day of 2017, though trading volumes were thin as many major markets observed New Year's holidays.\nKEEPING SCORE: Germany's DAX closed 1 per cent higher at 11,598.33 and France's CAC 40 rose 0.4 per cent to 4,882.38. Italy's FTSE MIB gained 1.7 per cent to 19,566.53, though trading was still suspended in the shares of Monte dei Paschi di Siena, the bank that is due to get a government bailout. Britain's FTSE 100, which closed at a record high on Friday, remained closed.\nUPBEAT DATA: Markets were buoyed by a report showing the manufacturing sector in the 19-country eurozone grew at the fastest rate in 68 months in December. The so-called purchasing managers' index rose to 54.9 points from 53.7 points in November. Also helping sentiment was a report published Sunday showing that China's manufacturing sector continued to expand in December, though at a slightly slower pace than the month before.\nANALYST TAKE: \"While the eurozone seems to have ended 2016 on the up in economic terms, we are concerned that GDP growth could be increasingly hampered in 2017 by political uncertainties,\" said Howard Archer, global economist at IHS Markit. Those uncertainties include Britain's formal start to talks to leave the European Union and elections in France and the Netherlands, where far-right parties that favour leaving the euro are expected to do well.\nHOLIDAY IMPACT: Trading was slow as many markets were closed to observe the New Year's holiday. Besides Britain, markets were closed in Japan, China and Hong Kong and were due to remain shut in New York. Of those that did trade in Asia, India's Sensex ended the day 0.1 per cent lower at 26,595.45 while South Korea's KOSPI was flat at 2,026.16.\nCURRENCIES: The dollar started the new year with broad gains in currency markets. It was at 117.46 yen, up from 117.00 the previous day. The euro was trading at $1.0476, from $1.0443.\nTrading in several commodities, including crude oil, was closed on Monday.",

The value of the cryptocurrency has quietly doubled in 2016. (Bogdan Cristel/Reuters) Related Stories How a $64M hack changed the fate of Ethereum, Bitcoin's closest competitor \nThe value of bitcoin is above $1,000 US on Monday, the first time that has been the case since December 2013. \nThe world's leading digital cryptocurrency was trading at $1,027 US per bitcoin on Monday, according to Coindesk, an increase of more than three per cent within a day. \nCreated in 2009, bitcoin was invented as an alternative to the world's paper currencies because it isn't tied to any physical assets or controlled by any country's central bank. It's pitched as an alternative to the fiat money system and is admired for its ability to easily transfer money without detection or interference from governments or multinational corporations. Bitcoin bank Flexcoin shuts down after $600,000 theft \nThe currency's value soared to more than $1,200 US in late 2013, as numerous debt crises in Europe called into the question the value of the continent's many fiat currencies. But bitcoin's value came crashing down a few months later when Mt. Gox, which was then the largest processor in the world of bitcoins, admitted that it had lost $450 million US worth of the supposedly secure currency due to theft. \nThe sell-off was so swift that as recently as two years ago, bitcoins were worth less than $250. Today, however, they are near their all time highs again. \nBitcoins have quietly doubled in value through 2016, and the surge picked up especially after the election of Donald Trump. \nBut the catalyst for the recent run-up appears to be moves by two governments in Asia. In November, the government of India moved to eliminate high-denomination bills to combat money laundering and counterfeiting . That has prompted a flood of capital to alternative forms of money, and bitcoin is benefiting from that sudden demand. \nChina has repeatedly moved recently to implement more capital controls on its currency, the yuan, to limit the amount that people can withdraw out of the country. That's made it harder for wealthy Chinese to get their money out of the country, so many have turned to bitcoin to move that cash. That's also contributing to the surge in bitcoin's value. \n\"The growing war on cash, and capital controls, is making bitcoin look like a viable, if high risk, alternative,\" Paul Gordon of digital currency firm Quantave told Reuters.

      "text": "With proper governance, life will improve for all. Benigno Aquino III. Introduction Multiple internal and external factors translate into large-scale transformation programs for an organisation. One primary reason for them to not deliver the outcomes is a lack of a good governance model, its implementation and acceptance within the organisation. Strong governance should not only be practised at a corporate level but also at a business transformation program or project level. The governance operating model and its implementation ensure that the transformation objectives are met, and they are realised in the business-as-usual mode when the transformation program is implemented. Ignorance, lack of commitment or failure to setup a governance model can backfire and be a recipe for transformational disaster. This article outlines the design considerations for setting up a governance operating model for transformation programs. It also describes a change governance process to further the effective implementation of the transformation program and transition to operations. \nPurpose \nA governance operating model defines the methods, structure and interfaces through which governance is mobilised. It is an imperative for transformation programs and enterprise governance boards to enhance their control and enable senior management to implement initiatives . \nSome of the typical objectives of the governance operating model are to: Enable the transformation programs to track and control change decisions (across business capabilities, processes, and artefacts) more effectively and collaboratively, thereby reducing the overall churn and costs Provide a streamlined approach to the review mechanisms and create efficiencies for key stakeholder groups and steering committee(s) in making decisions. Establish clear roles and responsibilities of the members of the governance steering committee and how they interface not only with the enterprise governance board but also other departments and operations once the governance operating model is implemented. Organise strategic, financial, compliance, operational and program level risk so that the governance committee can guide the program and/or operations to work in compliance with regulations and support the organisation’s objectives. \nDesign Considerations \nThe governance operating model is crucial in the ability to deliver the program’s services to the organisation. Having an effective governance operating model means that decision rights and service standards are clearly defined, regularly communicated to all stakeholders, well understood and adhered to. Figure 1: Governance Operating Model \nAs shown in Figure 1, the Governance Steering Committee for a transformation program is guided and supported by the Enterprise Governance Board, which comprises of CxOs and senior executives. Depending on the size of the change initiative, there could be one governance steering committee for one transformation program and it will have a set of key stakeholders picked dynamically from various teams (e.g. Legal, Compliance, Procurement, Technology, etc.) as deemed relevant for the transformation program and are highly impacted by the program. The governance operating model will guide and support the program stakeholders to deliver the transformation program. It will also further support business-as-usual (BAU) teams once the transformation program has transitioned to operations. Once a transformation program has been absorbed into the company operations, the governance steering committee will cater to the governance issues arising out of the business-as-usual activities. \nSome of the primary steps involved in designing the governance operating model involve: Identify key stakeholders who will be part of the governance model and which departments in the organisation are impacted. Define boundaries of business areas which the governance should touch upon in the organisation depending on the scope of the program. Identify owners of business process/business capability/artefact, who will: Spread the word about the transformation program & governance operating model and socialise the same with the larger enterprise. Own and help to resolve changes to the artefact, process, and business capability. Establish a RACI matrix and get a formal agreement of their roles and responsibilities from these owners and their delegates. Review and endorsement of crucial updates to existing methodologies and frameworks i.e. insertion of checkpoints to connect with the governance committee if any major change is to be affected to any artefacts, business domains or processes. Formulate a policy to institutionalise the governance operating model. This policy will outline: design principles of the transformation to dictate the operating rhythm of the governance committee roles and responsibilities of the members of the governance committee establish exception mechanisms and compliance requirements the end-to-end governance process policy currency, review requirements, and policy ownership Develop a change and communications plan to broadcast the governance operating model & committee and absorb its implementation in the organisation. Agree on the frequency of governance committee meetings to be scheduled during the transformation and post implementation, log decisions and deviations, and publish the minutes of meetings. Establish a single source of truth i.e. a repository of decisions taken during the previous governance forums as this will aid in taking future decisions. Determine interfaces with the enterprise governance board. An enterprise-wide Governance Board will provide guidance and support to the changes across the organisation and help spawn governance committees for transformation programs as and when needed. The enterprise governance board will enable smooth implementation of governance operating model post implementation of transformation. Establish business ownership of programs and initiatives and establish clear roles and responsibilities and interfaces with the enterprise governance board. \nOnce the transformation program has reached steady state and transitioned to operations, the governance steering committee will now perform the key governance functions required to sustain the change in business-as-usual mode. \nChange Governance Process \nOnce the transformation has reached its steady and/or transitioned into its operations and the governance operating model has been implemented, a governance process is required to maintain the operating rhythm of the governance committee. Primary function of governance committee then is to provide guidance to the business architecture activity i.e. ascertain, accept and absorb change into the system. Figure 2 shows a process cycle that ensures than any change to the business processes, business capabilities, and artefacts in purview of the change are seamlessly absorbed into the organisation operations. Figure 2: End-to-end change governance cycle \nThe change governance process can be broken down into the following process steps: Initiate – A request for change can be initiated for a business process, business capability, or an artefact. Any new program, any business unit or any person within the organisation can be a Change Initiator and initiate a request for change. Change Requests can also originate from the discussions in the regular governance meetings. Classify – The change request once reviewed and if accepted by the governance committee will be passed to the correct owner in the organisation. The Change Owner could be a person who is: Part of the governance committee itself Someone who is a head of the impacted business unit or The owner of the artefact, process, or business capability. Validate – The request is directed to the Change Owner for the related process, capability or artefact, who will determine if it is a valid request by performing a high-level impact assessment. If it is minor change, and needs no further review, it can be sent directly to the Approve If it is a major change, it needs further work/review. The Change Owner can assign a Change Reviewer to work on the request and loop in additional teams who should be involved in the review. Collaborate – Once the validation is complete and it is determined that the change requires further review, the Change Reviewer will perform a detailed impact assessment of the change and understand its impact to other business capabilities, processes, and artefacts. More reviewers from the relevant departments can be invited to perform the review of the impact analysis. The Change Owner monitors the progress. Once the Change Reviewer is satisfied, the change request along with the supporting documentation and high level solution recommendation is passed back to the Change Owner . Wherever the change impacts regulatory compliance, the legal staff and auditors will analyse the proposed solutions to ensure that they are within the legal boundaries of the organisation. Approve – The Change Owner finalises the change. Depending on the impact of the change, the business unit that will be most impacted by the change request will have to own the change and appoint a Sponsor , who is typically the senior executive in the organisation. The Sponsor may call in meetings with the governance committee, change owner and his team to review the change request and finally accept or reject it. Implement – Once the sponsor is satisfied with the reviews, s/he will set aside some budget for implementing the change and may request a business case for funding the change. This may follow the regular program execution cycle within the organisation. If the Sponsor is not satisfied with the reviews, additional information may be called for. If the Sponsor is still not satisfied or if the need for change has passed due to the changing business scenario, the Sponsor may take up the validity of the change request with the governance committee and Change Initiator and reach an agreement to store it for later use. Close – Depending on the outcome of the Approve and Implement steps, the decisions taken during the processes are recorded in a governance log for future reference. The person or the program, who initiated the change request will also be notified of the outcome and kept updated throughout the process. \nFigure 3 below describes the end-to-end process model for the change governance process. Figure 3: End-to-end change governance process model Benefits Better visibility – The governance operating model, gives the enterprise governance board and the governance committee those eyes and ears into the transformation programs and the changes being made to the business capabilities, processes, and artefacts during operations. Greater coordination and compliance – The end-to-end governance process streamlines the review and approval process for changes to a business capability, process, or an artefact. The governance log of decisions provides visibility of changes with appropriate reasoning. The robust governance processes enhance compliance by involving stakeholders from legal and regulatory departments at the right time thereby reducing risk. Enhanced effectiveness – The governance operating model reduces the build-up of isolated approaches for managing change. As a result, action items are clearly de-marked for each stakeholder for the overall success of the transformation program and once it has transitioned to operations. The governance operating model ensures that the people aspect of the change is included in the approach and guarantees a greater chance of success once it is in business-as-usual mode. \nConclusion \nThe success of the governance operating model will be directly proportional to how clearly the objectives of the committee have been outlined by the operating model. An effective governance operating model is an essential element for every successful transformation program. The governance operating model supplements the efficiency and speed at which the organisation embeds the transformation into its operations to achieve productivity, compliance and economies of scale. It also ensures that the right changes are owned and made to the right business capability, processes, and artefacts and those decisions surrounding these changes are clear and relevant to the entire enterprise. Clarity of formal responsibilities assigned to people involved ensures that they are accountable for responsibilities that need to be delivered. Centralised decision-making safeguards alignment of business units towards a common transformational goal. Recommended for you",

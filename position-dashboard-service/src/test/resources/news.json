      "text": "29 mins ago by Steven Loveday 2 Comments \nThe Electric Israeli has a Facebook page and a YouTube channel dedicated to electric cars, sustainable energy, and solar panels. He takes a long road trip on Interstate 95 (which runs from Maine to Florida) to show availability at six Tesla Supercharger stations along the way. Even in the busiest areas, Tesla Superchargers were readily available. This is bound to change drastically once there are many Tesla Model 3’s on roadways. \nHis travels take him from the Fort Lauderdale area in Florida, to his home in New Jersey. Unfortunately, he is driving an ICE vehicle, so he makes the extra stops at the Supercharger stations just for this “study.” (One might want to leap ahead to various station arrivals in the video if you don’t have a lot of time) \nVideo Description via The Electric Israeli on YouTube: \nAre Tesla Superchargers too crowded? Join me as I visit 6 Tesla Superchargers along Interstate 95. \nSurprisingly, some stations were nearly empty. He visits some at key times, while others are late in the evening or early in the morning. He tries to give as much info as possible, such as the time, the total amount of stalls, and the activity over a period of time. Even at the busiest stations, in congested areas of New Jersey, there were multiple spots to spare. He concludes that this will all change drastically once there are many Tesla Model 3’s on the road. \nHe plans to take a trip out to the west coast next summer and travel from San Francisco to Vancouver, making a similar account of Supercharger availability. \nCurrently there is about 110,000 Tesla vehicles on U.S. roadways. At some point in the foreseeable future, with current Model X and S deliveries, and some 400,000 Model 3 vehicles coming, this number will grow exponentially. He adds that his greater concern for Tesla’s future is service center availability.",

      "text": "Photo: Thomas Mielke One of the great things about Twitter is its ability to act as the proverbial office water cooler for a lot of us who no longer have steady access to an office water cooler; it's a mix of weird gossip, pompous pronouncements, hissing provocations, and all the other good stuff that comes with being around people, with the added bonus of being able to select just who you're likely to bump into at any one time (depending on retweets which originate from various uninvited and unsavory third parties, sincere intention to spark discussion notwithstanding).\n\nAnd like any proverbial water cooler, in that mix of gossip and pomposity and so on occasionally something genuinely interesting pops up.\n\nSo a bit more than a week ago we got this:\nWhat's the smallest engine you could use to power a car capable of moving under its own power? — Rory Carroll (@Rory_Carroll) December 28, 2016 Yeah, it sounds like the kind of question that would come up amongst a bunch of gearheads passing a bong and listening to Ummagumma -era Floyd in some off-campus basement. (Maybe that's actually what Twitter is?) But it's also a really good question.\n\nIn fact this is a great question, a gloriously iconoclastic inquiry in a world currently obsessed with Can-Am-grade outputs. Forget about the flood of recent mills that have made cars with 0-to-60 times in the four-second bracket seem lackluster. Set aside the Hellcats and the Lamborghini SVs and the ludicrous-mode Teslas and the rest. What's the least motor you need to get by in the world?\n\nOf course the answer is the same as the answer to the perennial question about what the Greatest Car In The World is: it depends *. Or, as quickly came up in the conversation:\n@HanSolex @Rory_Carroll Parameters to define here:\n\nMoving under it's own power: ___ m/s\n\nSmallest: Displacement, external package etc — Ben Wojdyla (@Ben_Wojdyla) December 29, 2016 Right. Of course this kind of rulemaking has a habit of getting into a deep ontological discussion about what a car actually is  and how ridiculously tiny and flimsy a structure one can propose and still take seriously, never mind the inevitable mind-expanding dive into the possibilities of gear reduction enabling a Cox .049 motor to 'technically' motivate a GMC 3500HD or whatever. But those both get to the absurdum part of a reductio ad absurdum way too quickly to be useful and eventually you're better off just admitting that the ultimate solution is to lose the motor completely and ride a bicycle, which is not a bad thing at all but also not the answer.\n\nIf we're going to take this seriously - and this is a question well worth taking very seriously - let's consider those parameters that Wojdyla brings up and fill in some sensible judgement calls:\nFirst, let's make this a real car and not a Peel P50 or go-kart or powered barstool or something like that. Yes, we'll obviously have to skew small here, but we also want this to be recognizable as a car and (mostly) work in the real world. So small two-seater or very small four-seater, which matters more as weight (and to a lesser extent air drag) than sheer size. Second, let's make this at least passably functional in the real world, which means that our hypothetical States of Motion MicroMotor Special will need to be able to achieve, oh, an arbitrary but not irrational 20 meters per second (that's 72 kph/~44.74 mph), which at least is good enough for suburban streets and country lanes if not Interstates. Yes, we're going to mostly be using metric through this; it's much easier to perform calculations. I'll throw in a few converted figures when necessary. And there will be a bit of discreet rounding here and there, but it should all work out in the end. Third, to simplify the whole process a bit we will disregard concerns about packaging and displacement and instead arrive at a solution based solely on output, which tends to generally dictate the rest of that anyway. Fourth, nothing else that we normally consider when thinking about a car - handling, design, safety, comfort, cruising range, long-term reliability, appeal to potential copulative partners - matters in the least here. We are strictly concerned with motivating a box capable of carrying a few nearly-normal-sized humans from one place to another. So let's think about what it actually means to power a vehicle based on some elementary physics.\n\nIn idealized steady-state driving, such as cruising along a flat and level highway, the vehicle only needs enough power to overcome various forms of drag, mostly air resistance and the deformation and stickiness of tires on the road surface, and some subsequent driveline friction. Find a way to reduce or eliminate that air resistance and tire drag - think magnetically-levitating hovercraft moving in a vacuum - and our vehicle acts as a pure inertia device which requires zero energy to keep moving. This doesn't work in the real world**, of course, but we can design this thing to be pretty slippery - and at 72 kph it's not going to be facing that much of a wall of air anyway - and we can also go ahead and specify ultra-low-rolling-resistance tires, maybe stolen from a first-gen Honda Insight or something. So barring a shipping container being dragged behind the car, cruising is not a major issue.\n\nI'll even say that acceleration isn't a huge issue here either. Yes, we need this thing to convert a certain amount of potential energy of some form into kinetic energy as it gathers up its skirts and eventually  works its way up to our 72 kph, but we won't have a mandatory minimum acceleration parameter. Any continuing application of force sufficient to overcome drag will result in acceleration (basically force = mass times acceleration - or, as we'll use later, acceleration = force/mass - with some minor parasitic factors) and we'll have an adequate amount of that given how this is something which will get resolved in the course of dealing with our biggest concern.\n\nThat biggest concern is what happens when that road isn't flat and level. We do not live on a giant ball bearing, and hills are a fact of life***. The SoM MicroMotor Special - oh, what the hell, let's call it the Mouse - will have to pull itself up an incline to be considered a functioning automobile, and this is where the fun starts.\nPhoto: Andreas Praefcke Let's add another bullet point to our list of Wojdyla parameters:\nThe vehicle must be able to climb an arbitrary 7% grade of indefinite length while maintaining a speed of 16 m/sec (57.6 kph/~35.8 mph). And for this to occur the motor must do honest-to-Archimedes work and deliver it at a set rate, which means we need to have a certain definite minimum power figure, which can be calculated.\n\nNotebooks out.\n\nSo some terms need to be clarified: First, we're concerned with weight instead of mass. Mass is a measure of how much matter something contains; weight is that matter under the influence of gravity. A kilogram really doesn't weigh one kilogram, but rather 9.8 newtons***.\n\nWork is the act of moving an object by applying force. More commonly, and more relevant to our concerns, it's the act lifting a certain weight a certain distance or rotating an arm (or a wheel, which is just kind of a continuous arm if you think about it...hey, anything left in the bong?) around an axis, which we all know as that glorious thing that is torque.\n\nPower is the act of performing that work in a certain time.\n\nLet's get our parameters set up in real units:\n\nA 7% grade is almost exactly 4 degrees from horizontal. That doesn't sound like much until you have to climb it; a 7% grade is the maximum permitted on Interstate highways and even then only for short distances in mountainous terrain (a 6% maximum is more generally enforced). For visualization purposes, 7%/4° converts to a rise of 1 meter for every 14.3 meters in straightline distance.\n\nWe next need to consider the weight of the vehicle. Naturally the Mouse will be as light as is practical, but again we're aiming for at least some sort of real-world relevance so yes, a real structure, and no, not a carbon-fiber skeleton wearing a Reynolds Wrap skin. Quick research shows that most tiny people movers with (ostensibly) four seats - the Tata Nano, the original Issigonis Mini - scale in at about 600kg. Weave in some Japanese engineering genius and a small parallel-twin motorcycle engine and you have the Honda N360, which weighs about 500kg and which we'll accept as a reasonable minimum for something that won't fold in on itself .\n\nPhoto:  天然ガス That's just for the vehicle; at the very least we also have to include a driver. Yes, we could hire some winsome and fawnlike ultralight Eastern European fashion model to be our test driver, but let's again aim for a certain real-world element. Propriety says that to cover various arrangements of passengers and luggage and drinks in cupholders and whatever we should skew the driver's mass slightly large, towards the Matt Farah/Jack Baruth/yr hmbl svt end of the body mass index, and so we'll add 100kg as our operator/payload mass.\n\nThat gets us up to 600kg that has to be hauled up this 7%/4° grade at the mandated 16m/sec by something more than good intentions.\n\nThe equation to find the required power turns out to be very straightforward, especially when using those metric units:\n\nWeight  (in newtons) times rate  (in meters per second) times distance (vertical component only since that's what the work here is doing so sine of 4°) equals power in watts.\n\n(Yeah, I also thought it was too simple at first as well, except that a watt is defined as (kg × m²)/sec³ so that cleans it up in a hurry.)\n\nPlug in our Wojdyla parameters of 600kg vehicle mass and 16m/sec speed up the incline, and using the accepted 9.8m/sec² constant for gravity and rounding sin(4°) from 0.069756474... to a more palatable .07:\n\n600 × 9.8 × 16 × .07 = 6585.6 watts \nOr 6.6 kilowatts, or 8.85 horsepower. Add 10% or so for mechanical losses and various invocations of the Second Law of Thermodynamics and we can say that the Mouse really needs no more than 7.5 kilowatts, or 10 horsepower.\n\nThat's not much as far as motors go, even in the pre-Hellcat era.\n\nJust for the sake of it let's figure out the resultant torque and acceleration.\n\nTwo things: First, given a constant power output the motor can either spin faster with less torque or spin slower with more torque. A motor producing x torque but turning at n rpm will make the same power as one producing 2 x torque and turning at n /2 rpm. This conversion will happen repeatedly below.\n\nSecond, one important note about calculating this and what it means to the vehicle itself: In order to know how much force is being applied to the pavement, we naturally need to know how much force the motor is generating at any one instant. This is not an easy thing to do with internal-combustion motors; because of cam timing and ignition curves and a bunch of other factors they do not produce consistent torque throgh the rev range, which anyone who has ever looked at a dyno chart knows. If we fitted the Mouse with a CVT we could theoretically have it run at a consistent ideal speed, but it's better to go ahead and use a power source which produces wonderfully steady (if subjectively boring) torque, run through a constant ratio.\n\nYes, it's an electric Mouse.\n\nOkay, so those wheels and tires we stole off of someone's 2000 Insight are sized 165/65R14, so they have a diameter of just about 179cm. In order to make the Mouse move at that mandated flat-surface speed of 20m/sec they have to rotate 11.17 times per second, or 670.39 times per minute.\n\n10 horsepower being delivered at 671 rpm translates to a decent 78.3 foot-pounds of torque, or 106.16 joules, delivered consistently at the contact patch. (The motor will spin a bit faster; redlines on  commonly available 10hp electric motors tend to be around 1700-1800 rpm . If we run it through effective 2.6:1 reduction gearing, that means the motor is making about 30 foot-pounds, or 41 joules. Seems about right.)\n\nThe radius of the wheel-tire combo is 28.45cm (1/3.515 of a meter) and 106.16 joules is 106.16 newton-meters, so the drive wheels are pushing the Mouse forward with a force of 106.16  ×  3.515 = 373.146 newtons.\n\nOur 600kg Mouse will accelerate at a more or less consistent rate of 0.62 meters per second, per second. It will take a little something over 32 seconds to hit our mandatory top speed of 20m/sec - but it will eventually get there.\n\nYeah. Um...that's slow . Admittedly if we used a multiple-ratio gearbox we could use that magical reduction gearing from very early on to get more force to the ground and clip a substantial amount of time off of this figure. Something to maybe work on later.\n\n\n\nHaving gotten through all this, let's look at some parallel real-world/historical examples of barely-adequately-powered vehicles, even if none of them are electrics:\n\nPhoto: Daimler-Benz We might as well start at the beginning. The Benz Patent-Motorwagen produced a whole roaring 2/3 of a horsepower (500 watts) from its near-liter of displacement but did so at all of 250 rpm, which means that torque at that engine speed was a slightly more palatable 14 lb/ft or 19 joules. (And it probably needed every bit of it to rotate those big carriage wheels from a start.) Even so, it was enough to get Berta Benz and her two teenage boys through a near-200km round trip to see her mama at about 15kph.\n\nThe N360 from earlier was overpowered for our purposes; its 354cc parallel-twin spun out 23kW, or about 31bhp, and top speed was an excessive 105kph/~65mph.\n\nPhoto: Thomas Forsman The closest equivalent to the Mouse in real life is probably the Citroën 2CV, which weighs about 600 kg and in its early 375cc form cranked out 9 hp/6.7kW - although as with the Benz that would likely translate into a somewhat less existentially troubling torque figure. Unfortunately, its top speed of 65 kph was apparently adequate when meandering from charming Gallic village to charming Gallic village in the 1950s but doesn't measure up to our modern requirement. The electric motor might provide a bit more speed, though, and its super-short 1st gear apparently gave it some impressive grade/stair-climbing potential, though.\n\nSo that's what you need . Would anyone actually want a Mouse, though? No, not really. The inability to operate at Interstate speeds is a massive handicap, general around-town effectiveness would be marginal at best, and again we haven't thought about anything else that goes into making this thing the slightest bit likeable.\n\nAbsolute minimum real-world power is probably along the lines of a 36hp Volkswagen Beetle, which again does better if you measure torque; in more realistic terms the 68hp of a three-cylinder Mitsubishi Mirage is about as low as anyone is willing to go to propel a modern car. Even the very Mouse-like Mitsu i-MiEV makes 63hp from its electric motor, and no one thinks of that as a rational all-around vehicle.\n\nBut I do sometimes think it would be cool to own a 2CV, though.\n\n\n\n*: Of course this answer is a total evasion. Everyone really knows that the Greatest Car In The World is an Alfa Romeo Giulia TZ2, unless you unfortunately have to carry more than one other person with you and in that case it's a Mercedes W123 wagon. But no one wants to say this all the time because most normal people tend to get that kind of furrowed-brow thing going on when you say this, so it's better to punt.\n\n**: Although I'm certain someone in Silicon Valley thinks otherwise and will be hitting up venture capital shops to fund this particular exercise in disrupting an anachronistic status quo as soon as they figure out how to put it in an app.\n\n***: No, not that kind .\n\n****: Residents of Kansas may beg to differ.\n\n: Seriously. Even early Lotus Sevens weighed around 500kg (and those occasionally folded in on themselves).\n\n: By happy coincidence also the normal weight of an average adult male Ailuropoda melanoleuca , or giant panda.\n\n: Maybe we should find one of those Eastern European models.",

      "title": "#OilandGas Report - January 6, 2016",
      "text": "\nFriday, January 6, 2017 \n\nOil prices are set to end the week slightly up from where it started, following a few rocky days of trading. After a sharp correction earlier in the week, oil regained ground on a steep fall in crude oil inventories. Still, the gains would have been much larger if not for the fact that U.S. gasoline stocks rose sharply. Nevertheless, oil is starting off the year on a positive note, and early signs of OPEC compliance (more below) are buoying the market.\n\nTesla gigafactory starts up.  Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)  announced that its gigafactory has started commercial production of batteries at its much-hyped gigafactory in Nevada. The inauguration of mass battery production marks a new era for the energy industry. The gigafactory could lower the cost of batteries for electric vehicles as well as home energy storage systems. Tesla says that at peak production, slated for 2018, the factory will add as much battery capacity to the global market as the rest of the world currently produces.  \n\n\n\n\nU.S. to become net-energy exporter.  The EIA released its  Annual Energy Outlook 2017 , with projections out through 2050. The report estimates that the U.S. will become a net-energy exporter in the years ahead under most of its possible scenarios. That is largely due to falling oil imports and rising natural gas exports. The higher energy prices go, the quicker the U.S. becomes a net-exporter.\n\nSaudi Arabia says that it is already is complying with OPEC deal.  Saudi Arabia offered encouragement to oil traders this week when it  announced  that it is lowering its output to 10.058 million barrels per day (mb/d) in January, complying with its promised cuts laid out in the November OPEC deal. OPEC members are required to bring their six-month average production levels to the targeted range, but Saudi Arabia said it will meet that level immediately. The announcement adds credibility to the deal and raises the likelihood that other members will comply with their targets.\n\nSecond quarter to see tightest supply conditions.  The second quarter of 2017 appears to be the period of time in which the global oil market will experience its tightest conditions: Other OPEC members will ratchet down their production levels to comply with the deal; non-OPEC countries including Russia will lower output; U.S. refineries will begin to ramp up operations to meet summer driving demand; Middle East countries such as Saudi Arabia and Iraq burn more oil in warmer months; inventories will decline as supply drops; plus underlying growth in oil demand continues to soak up excess supply. Many oil analysts expect oil prices to rise the most in the first two quarters of 2017, with the market easing in the second half of the year, potentially leading to lower prices in late 2017.  \n\n\n\n\nSpeculative bets on rising oil prices continue to increase.  Oil speculators continued to add bullish bets on oil prices at the end of 2016. For the week ending on December 27, bullish positions rose by 7 percent to 358,573, with the current makeup the most net-long since 2014. Long bets outnumbered short positions by a factor of 35 to 1,  the WSJ reports . That sets up the market for downside risk if bearish news emerges in the coming weeks. If speculators get spooked, they could begin to unwind their positions rapidly, leading to a sharp correction in oil prices.  \n\n\n  Oil deals hit $69 billion in 2016.  Oil M&A activity reached $69 billion in 2016, more than double the total from the year before, according to research firm PLS. Much of that activity was focused in the Permian Basin in West Texas, as companies rushed to scoop up acreage in the country’s most prolific shale basin. \"In 2017, we do believe that acquisition activity will expand beyond the Permian into other known, proven plays that become significantly more economic at pricing above $50,\" Brian Lidsky, managing director of research and content at PLS, told  CNBC. \nGoldman Sachs sees EOG Resources as “favorite” pick.  Goldman Sachs’ says that  EOG Resources (NYSE: EOG)  is their  “favorite” pick  in the E&P space, noting that the company could grow production 20 percent annually through 2020. EOG will have free cash flow in 2018 and beyond; the company will also see expensive rig contracts signed back in 2014 start to expire this year, reducing costs; and EOG is working through already drilled but uncompleted wells this year, which should boost cash flow.  \n\n\n\n\nOPEC production falls in December.  Output from the cartel dipped in December on falling Nigerian output. Nigeria was exempted from the OPEC deal, but saw its production fall by 200,000 bpd in December. Meanwhile,  Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE: RDS.A)   shut down  the Trans Niger Pipeline this week after a fire struck the line. The pipeline is one of the country’s largest, able to transport 180,000 barrels per day to the Bonny Export Terminal. The outage raises the possibility that Nigeria’s oil production could fall even further. Output was down to 1.45 million barrels per day in December, not far above the 1.39 mb/d low reached in August.\n\nChina to invest $360 billion in clean energy.  China  announced  plans to invest $360 billion in renewable energy over the next four years. The move comes as Beijing has been choked in smog this winter, adding urgency to the country’s campaign to cut pollution. Separately, a  report  from the Institute for Energy Economics & Financial Analysis finds that China is surpassing the U.S. in clean energy investment and leadership. At a time when U.S. president-elect Donald Trump is poised to roll back clean energy investment, China could widen its lead over the U.S. in an industry that could dominate the 21st century energy landscape.  \n\n\n\n\nNew gasoline taxes.  The U.S. has seen gasoline consumption rise to record highs, but consumption could flatten out as oil prices rise. Gasoline  prices  are now 35 cents per gallon higher than they were a year ago. On top of that, several U.S. states have imposed steeper gasoline taxes that came into effect in the New Year. New Jersey tops the list, adding a 23-cent per gallon tax at the pump.  \n\n\n\n\n\nGlobal Energy Advisory  January 6th 2017 Politics, Geopolitics & Conflict \n\n•    In Libya, the Deputy Prime Minister of the UN-backed Government of National Accord has handed in his resignation. Musa al-Koni told media that the GNA has proved unable to handle the numerous challenges Libya has to deal with, from widespread violence to lack of adequate healthcare. Al-Koni added that he considers the GNA responsible for the violence that has been tearing the country apart in the past year and that he acknowledges its failure to solve them. The resignation is indicative of how difficult it continues to be for Libya’s authorities to establish control over the civil war-torn country and steer it on the way to normalcy.\n\nBut it’s been a busy week for Libya all around, and for now it looks like General Haftar, leader of the Libyan National Army (LNA) is poised to continue solidifying power. Since taking back the country’s oil and then handing it over to the appropriate National Oil Company (NOC) earlier this year, Libya has been re-opening export terminals that have been shut down for more than two years and ramping up production just as OPEC agrees to cuts that exempt the North African nation. Earlier this week, Libya announced that it had reached production of close to 700,000 barrels per day and is eyeing 900,000 bpd over the next few months, with a hoped-for 1 million barrels by year’s end. At the same time, it’s also preparing to re-open the last remaining port that was shut down—Zawiya, the last of nine ports to re-open. This news follows news that the pipeline feeding crude to this port has been re-opened. Simultaneously, the Petroleum Facilities Guard (PFG), the hired militia that had been hijacking the country’s ports and terminals for over two years until Haftar pushed them out, is now withdrawing from Zawiya, where they served as ‘security’. This should be yet another indication that Haftar is consolidating his power (amid hopes that he’s not going to be another Ghaddafi at home).\n\n•    Turkey has become a major target for the Islamic State, according to defectors from the terrorist group. The New Year’s Eve attack in Istanbul that resulted in 39 casualties may be only the start, as ISIS is being pushed out of Iraq and Syria and is blaming, among others, Turkey. From the group’s perspective, Turkey is particularly guilty because it is a Muslim state but has teamed up with non-Muslim states in this fight. Turkey has long played an untenable role in the Syrian conflict, at times clearly viewing ISIS as a corridor of sorts that would help indirectly in Turkey’s renewed, embryonic empire-building aspirations. The cat-and-mouse game Turkey is playing with all parties in this conflict essentially means that all of its allies are also enemies, so we will be looking to 2017 for some significant challenges to Turkey’s security.\n\n•    Militant Arab separatists are rearing their heads in southern Iran. This week, one local organization that calls itself the Arab Struggle Movement for the Liberation of al-Ahwaz claimed to have bombed two oil pipelines in the oil-rich Kuzhestan province in southern Iran. It also claimed it had caused severe damage to the infrastructure. The Iranian Interior Ministry denied the claim but the fact remains that a separatist movement is brewing in one of the most oil-rich regions of Iran and is threatening attacks on oil infrastructure over the rest of the year.\n\n•    Nicolas Maduro, Venezuela’s President, has appointed a new Finance Minister and Economy Vice-President, a double role to be filled by a former MP, and a new Oil Minister – PDVSA’s former head of U.S. Citgo operations, Nelson Martinez. The ex-Oil Minister Eulogio del Pino will remain at the helm of the state oil company. The shuffle probably aims to solidify the troubled government’s position amid protests caused by triple-digit recession, food shortages and calls from the opposition for Maduro to step down and let someone else – the opposition – fix things.\n\n•    Finally, it should be an interesting year geopolitically for the offshore oil exploration world, as Lebanon finally passes two decrees that were languishing in purgatory for years but now will open up the playing field for exploration of the country’s part of the prolific Levant Basin—the same basin where neighbor Israel made its discovery of the supergiant Leviathan gas field and the already-producing Tamar gas field. Cyprus and Syria also share this basin, and exploration isn’t likely to go down without some maritime border battling.\n\nDeals, Mergers & Acquisitions \n\n•    Blackstone is considering an acquisition of assets from Energy Transfer Partners, the company behind the controversial Dakota Access oil pipeline. Although nothing about the nature of the assets to be sold has been divulged, the Dakota Access project may be one of them. Energy Transfer late last year agreed to be acquired by sister company Sunoco Logistics Partners.\n\n•    Total plans to invest $1 billion in Brazil annually, under a partnership with Petrobras closed last year. The investments will cover both upstream and downstream operations and will include technology development as well as exploration and production. As part of the plan, Total will acquire stakes in two of the most promising plots in the prolific Santos Basin, where a lot of Brazil’s presalt oil and gas deposits are located.\n\n•    BP has agreed to acquire a network of Woolworths fuel stations in Australia worth $1.3 billion. The deal involves 527 outlets, complete with convenience stores, as well as 16 ones under construction. These will be rebranded and added to BP’s already existing network of 350 stations across Australia.\n\n•    Freeport McMoRan has sold $592 million worth of oil and gas assets in California. The buyer is Sentinel Peak Resources California LLC. The assets will be paid for in cash and the copper miner will have rights to additional payments of $50 million in 2018, 2019, and 2020 as long as oil prices rise to $70 a barrel or more on average for each of these years.\n\n•    SМ Energy plans to sell assets worth $800 million in Eagle Ford. The assets include 37,500 acres producing 27,260 barrels of oil equivalent daily, plus related infrastructure. The buyer is Venado Oil and Gas LLC, a unit of private equity major Kohlberg Kravis Roberts.\n\n•    Israeli Delek Group will buy all the shares of Alon USA that it doesn’t already own in a deal valuing the company at $868 million. Prior to the deal, Delek had 47 percent of Alon’s stock.\n\n•    Whiting Petroleum has completed the sale of a 50 percent holding in the Robinson Lake gas processing plant and its interest in a natural gas gathering system in North Dakota, for a total consideration of $375 million.\n\nTenders, Auctions & Contracts \n\n•    Gazprom has awarded three contracts worth a total $654 million to Stroygazmontazh for the construction of a stretch of a gas pipeline. The Ukhta-Torzhok 2 pipeline will feed natural gas into the domestic gas distribution network as well as into the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline to Europe.\n\n•    Petronas has picked a new shipping site for its $27-billion Pacific Northwest LNG project in western Canada. The move is prompted by local opposition to the project as it is now, as well as efforts to lower its cost. While the liquefaction trains will be located on Lelu Island, the shipping site, where ships will dock to load the fuel, will be moved to neighboring Ridley Island, which is outside an environmentally sensitive area and where the construction of the berths will be cheaper.\n\n•    Italy’s Eni has been awarded two new exploration licenses off the shores of Cyprus. The company will get a 50 percent stake and the operatorship of one of the blocks, and 100 percent in the second one. Eni already has licenses for three exploration blocks in the area, on the Egyptian side.\n\n•    Egypt has sealed exploration deals worth $220 million with BP, Total, and Eni and concern exploration blocks in the Mediterranean. Six wells will be drilled under the agreements by the three companies.\n\nCompany News \n\n•    Three more oil and gas independents in the U.S. are about to file for bankruptcy in the next month or so: Memorial Production Partners, Forbes Energy Services, and Bonanza Creek Energy, adding to the more than 200 businesses that went under during the oil price crash. This year, however, the pace of bankruptcy filings is expected to slow down substantially and a boom in IPOs may well be on the way. Deregulation when Trump takes office as president, coupled with higher oil prices, should they last, will be the drivers behind the increase in listings.\n\n•    Oil trader Gunvor Group is suing its partner in a failed bid for Chevron assets, Cerberus Capital management, for refusing to shoulder its share of the costs, which the partners incurred when their $650-million offer failed. Guvnor says it spent $1.6 million on conducting due diligence on the assets and Cerberus was supposed to supply half of that, which it didn’t do.\n\nDiscovery & Development \n\n•    Gazprom Neft said it may suspend production at several wells this year as part of efforts to optimize production. The company also expects lower output growth at other wells, although as a whole it plans to pump 5 percent more oil this year than last. The increase is a reduction from an earlier growth rate, in compliance with the company’s commitments under the OPEC-Russia production cut agreement.\n\n•    Shell has failed to find oil in two wells drilled off the Tanzanian coast. The company has partnered on exploration in the area with Ophir Energy, which said that the wells were drilled on time and safely but failed to yield any oil or gas.\n\n•    Maersk Oil plans to stop production at Denmark’s largest gas field, Tyra, next year. The reason is that there is currently no economically viable way to extract what gas remains at the field. Tyra has been the main source of gas in the Danish part of the North Sea since 1984.\n\n•    Chevron has restarted production at its giant Gorgon LNG field off the Australian coast. It was suspended since November, for the second time in 2016, due to performance issues, according to the company.\n\n•    Indian Summit Group has signed a deal with Bangladesh’ Petrobangla for the construction of a $500-million LNG plant in Bangladesh, on Moheshkali Island. Construction should be completed  within 18 months  of signing the final agreement. LNG is the optimal fuel for energy demand in Bangladesh, according to government officials, due to its low cost, lower emission rate and quick to produce.\n\nOILPRICE.COM \nhttp://nangalama.blogspot.com/2017/01/oilandgas-report-january-6-2016.html ",

      "text": "Where there is no vision, the people perish.\nKing Solomon in the Book of Proverbs Have you ever got all caught up in a political campaign where you would do almost anything to see your candidate win, and she didn’t even make the primaries?\nPerhaps you were deeply moved, touched and inspired by a real flesh-and-blood guru, convinced he was the way, the truth and the life, and no one else agreed with you. People told you to stop wasting your time and go get a life. Do you remember how it felt?\nAt such times, it is easy to give up and ask yourself, “What is the point of it all?” You feel like such a fool! How could life be so cruel?\nWhat Is Inner Vision? Inner vision is the ability to look within and see your heart’s desire. It could be a hot new Tesla. It could be a gorgeous young wife who adores you.\nIt could be a software executive of a cutting-edge, rising-star startup. It could be a global society where people spontaneously love each other, as in John Lennon’s immortal hymn, “Imagine.”\nInner vision is whatever ignites the fire within you.\n\n//<![CDATA[\n(function(){var g=this,h=function(b,d){var a=b.split(\".\"),c=g;a[0]in c||!c.execScript||c.execScript(\"var \"+a[0]);for(var e;a.length&&(e=a.shift());)a.length||void 0===d?c[e]?c=c[e]:c=c[e]={}:c[e]=d};var l=function(b){var d=b.length;if(0<d){for(var a=Array(d),c=0;c=d.offsetWidth&&0>=d.offsetHeight)a=!1;else{c=d.getBoundingClientRect();var f=document.body;a=c.top+(“pageYOffset”in window?window.pageYOffset:(document.documentElement||f.parentNode||f).scrollTop);c=c.left+(“pageXOffset”in window?window.pageXOffset:(document.documentElement||f.parentNode||f).scrollLeft);f=a.toString()+”,”+c;b.b.hasOwnProperty(f)?a=!1:(b.b[f]=!0,a=a<=b.e.height&&c<=b.e.width)}a&&(b.a.push(e),b.d[e]=!0)};p.prototype.checkImageForCriticality=function(b){b.getBoundingClientRect&&q(this,b)};h(\"pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality\",function(b){n.checkImageForCriticality(b)});h(\"pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkCriticalImages\",function(){r(n)});var r=function(b){b.b={};for(var d=[\"IMG\",\"INPUT\"],a=[],c=0;c<d.length;++c)a=a.concat(l(document.getElementsByTagName(d[c])));if(0!=a.length&&a[0].getBoundingClientRect){for(c=0;d=a[c];++c)q(b,d);a=\"oh=\"+b.i;b.c&&(a+=\"&n=\"+b.c);if(d=0!=b.a.length)for(a+=\"&ci=\"+encodeURIComponent(b.a[0]),c=1;c =a.length+e.length&&(a+=e)}b.g&&(e=”&rd=”+encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify(s())),131072>=a.length+e.length&&(a+=e),d=!0);t=a;if(d){c=b.f;b=b.h;var f;if(window.XMLHttpRequest)f=new XMLHttpRequest;else if(window.ActiveXObject)try{f=new ActiveXObject(“Msxml2.XMLHTTP”)}catch(k){try{f=new ActiveXObject(“Microsoft.XMLHTTP”)}catch(u){}}f&&(f.open(“POST”,c+(-1==c.indexOf(“?”)?”?”:”&”)+”url=”+encodeURIComponent(b)),f.setRequestHeader(“Content-Type”,”application/x-www-form-urlencoded”),f.send(a))}}},s=function(){var b={},d=document.getElementsByTagName(“IMG”);if(0==d.length)return{};var a=d[0];if(!(“naturalWidth”in a&&”naturalHeight”in a))return{};for(var c=0;a=d[c];++c){var e=a.getAttribute(“pagespeed_url_hash”);e&&(!(e in b)&&0<a.width&&0<a.height&&0<a.naturalWidth&&0 =b[e].k&&a.height>=b[e].j)&&(b[e]={rw:a.width,rh:a.height,ow:a.naturalWidth,oh:a.naturalHeight})}return b},t=””;h(“pagespeed.CriticalImages.getBeaconData”,function(){return t});h(“pagespeed.CriticalImages.Run”,function(b,d,a,c,e,f){var k=new p(b,d,a,e,f);n=k;c&&m(function(){window.setTimeout(function(){r(k)},0)})});})();pagespeed.CriticalImages.Run(‘/mod_pagespeed_beacon’,’ http://www.consciousowl.com/wp-content/plugins/thrive-visual-editor/shortcodes/templates/thrv_image_load.php&#8217 ;,’3TYopLAIql’,true,false,’BIqHLadTYBg’);\n//]]> \nInner vision is more than a simple visualization process, although visualization is indispensable. It is a living dream that drives you into action to change your world, if not THE world.\nIt is a condition or outcome that you come back to daily, if not hourly, to reaffirm as a living possibility, as was the case of Mahatma Gandhi for a free India, and a world of justice and tolerance for all.\nInner vision can be thought of as a magnificent obsession that will not let you go. You might be in an ecommerce start up where you have to gross a million dollars by the end of the year. You are willing to do anything required to make the money.\nYou clearly see what you can do with that million dollars, not only in terms of a better lifestyle, but by way of making a contribution to humanity and the environment while there is still time.\nWhat Is Inner Power? Inner power is a Clint Eastwood with no gun, a samurai with no one to kill, whose whole focus is to calm you down and give you profound faith in the moment by virtue of his presence.\nInner power is a beautiful, gracious woman who totally owns her femininity, has nothing to prove and is wholly devoted to make a man feel like a man.\nInner power emerges from a man or woman who is at peace with God and the Universe. He or she has nothing to prove and is totally caught up in a cause that makes him the servant of all.\nYou have the conviction that you cannot really lose. Each moment is a divine gift to bring about heaven on earth.\n\n//<![CDATA[\n(function(){var g=this,h=function(b,d){var a=b.split(\".\"),c=g;a[0]in c||!c.execScript||c.execScript(\"var \"+a[0]);for(var e;a.length&&(e=a.shift());)a.length||void 0===d?c[e]?c=c[e]:c=c[e]={}:c[e]=d};var l=function(b){var d=b.length;if(0<d){for(var a=Array(d),c=0;c=d.offsetWidth&&0>=d.offsetHeight)a=!1;else{c=d.getBoundingClientRect();var f=document.body;a=c.top+(“pageYOffset”in window?window.pageYOffset:(document.documentElement||f.parentNode||f).scrollTop);c=c.left+(“pageXOffset”in window?window.pageXOffset:(document.documentElement||f.parentNode||f).scrollLeft);f=a.toString()+”,”+c;b.b.hasOwnProperty(f)?a=!1:(b.b[f]=!0,a=a<=b.e.height&&c<=b.e.width)}a&&(b.a.push(e),b.d[e]=!0)};p.prototype.checkImageForCriticality=function(b){b.getBoundingClientRect&&q(this,b)};h(\"pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality\",function(b){n.checkImageForCriticality(b)});h(\"pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkCriticalImages\",function(){r(n)});var r=function(b){b.b={};for(var d=[\"IMG\",\"INPUT\"],a=[],c=0;c<d.length;++c)a=a.concat(l(document.getElementsByTagName(d[c])));if(0!=a.length&&a[0].getBoundingClientRect){for(c=0;d=a[c];++c)q(b,d);a=\"oh=\"+b.i;b.c&&(a+=\"&n=\"+b.c);if(d=0!=b.a.length)for(a+=\"&ci=\"+encodeURIComponent(b.a[0]),c=1;c =a.length+e.length&&(a+=e)}b.g&&(e=”&rd=”+encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify(s())),131072>=a.length+e.length&&(a+=e),d=!0);t=a;if(d){c=b.f;b=b.h;var f;if(window.XMLHttpRequest)f=new XMLHttpRequest;else if(window.ActiveXObject)try{f=new ActiveXObject(“Msxml2.XMLHTTP”)}catch(k){try{f=new ActiveXObject(“Microsoft.XMLHTTP”)}catch(u){}}f&&(f.open(“POST”,c+(-1==c.indexOf(“?”)?”?”:”&”)+”url=”+encodeURIComponent(b)),f.setRequestHeader(“Content-Type”,”application/x-www-form-urlencoded”),f.send(a))}}},s=function(){var b={},d=document.getElementsByTagName(“IMG”);if(0==d.length)return{};var a=d[0];if(!(“naturalWidth”in a&&”naturalHeight”in a))return{};for(var c=0;a=d[c];++c){var e=a.getAttribute(“pagespeed_url_hash”);e&&(!(e in b)&&0<a.width&&0<a.height&&0<a.naturalWidth&&0 =b[e].k&&a.height>=b[e].j)&&(b[e]={rw:a.width,rh:a.height,ow:a.naturalWidth,oh:a.naturalHeight})}return b},t=””;h(“pagespeed.CriticalImages.getBeaconData”,function(){return t});h(“pagespeed.CriticalImages.Run”,function(b,d,a,c,e,f){var k=new p(b,d,a,e,f);n=k;c&&m(function(){window.setTimeout(function(){r(k)},0)})});})();pagespeed.CriticalImages.Run(‘/mod_pagespeed_beacon’,’ http://www.consciousowl.com/wp-content/plugins/thrive-visual-editor/shortcodes/templates/thrv_image_load.php&#8217 ;,’3TYopLAIql’,true,false,’owfFoXRGDzo’);\n//]]> \nWhy Is Inner Power Inseparable from Inner Vision? Faith has been defined as the capacity to see what God intends to do and to cooperate with Him in accomplishing it.\nWith a firm grounding in Infinite Intelligence and Higher Power, you know this isn’t all by accident. Rather, it is a divine play in which God assumes an active role and has placed you on stage as a star chosen to make it a truly magnificent story.\nYou realize all this, not by outer vision. You don’t necessarily deduce it from the exact circumstances, which may appear highly unfavorable, as was the United States in 2008 when President Obama first took office in the face of a possible global financial meltdown.\nYou have a powerful intuition of what is possible, and you sense that your dream wants to happen.\nFor example, after Mother Theresa held a dying “untouchable” mother in her arms, she committed to do everything within her power to transform both Calcutta, and the world.\nThe inner vision opens up an inner power that comes straight from God. You cannot imitate it. You have to find it already within you.\nYou don’t look to the small you, but to the great Y-O-U. You surrender to the vision and commit to living it. At some point, Higher Power kicks in, and you never look back.\nHow Can You Activate Your Inner Vision? You can begin to activate your inner vision by aligning with one or more of the great spiritual traditions and consulting a past or present master, man or woman, who totally speaks to you.\nYou might choose a book, a video on YouTube or an interview with one of His or Her adherents. Let it speak to you deeply within. Who are you? Where did you come from? Where are you going? What is your focus in this incarnation? \n\n//<![CDATA[\n(function(){var g=this,h=function(b,d){var a=b.split(\".\"),c=g;a[0]in c||!c.execScript||c.execScript(\"var \"+a[0]);for(var e;a.length&&(e=a.shift());)a.length||void 0===d?c[e]?c=c[e]:c=c[e]={}:c[e]=d};var l=function(b){var d=b.length;if(0<d){for(var a=Array(d),c=0;c=d.offsetWidth&&0>=d.offsetHeight)a=!1;else{c=d.getBoundingClientRect();var f=document.body;a=c.top+(“pageYOffset”in window?window.pageYOffset:(document.documentElement||f.parentNode||f).scrollTop);c=c.left+(“pageXOffset”in window?window.pageXOffset:(document.documentElement||f.parentNode||f).scrollLeft);f=a.toString()+”,”+c;b.b.hasOwnProperty(f)?a=!1:(b.b[f]=!0,a=a<=b.e.height&&c<=b.e.width)}a&&(b.a.push(e),b.d[e]=!0)};p.prototype.checkImageForCriticality=function(b){b.getBoundingClientRect&&q(this,b)};h(\"pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality\",function(b){n.checkImageForCriticality(b)});h(\"pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkCriticalImages\",function(){r(n)});var r=function(b){b.b={};for(var d=[\"IMG\",\"INPUT\"],a=[],c=0;c<d.length;++c)a=a.concat(l(document.getElementsByTagName(d[c])));if(0!=a.length&&a[0].getBoundingClientRect){for(c=0;d=a[c];++c)q(b,d);a=\"oh=\"+b.i;b.c&&(a+=\"&n=\"+b.c);if(d=0!=b.a.length)for(a+=\"&ci=\"+encodeURIComponent(b.a[0]),c=1;c =a.length+e.length&&(a+=e)}b.g&&(e=”&rd=”+encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify(s())),131072>=a.length+e.length&&(a+=e),d=!0);t=a;if(d){c=b.f;b=b.h;var f;if(window.XMLHttpRequest)f=new XMLHttpRequest;else if(window.ActiveXObject)try{f=new ActiveXObject(“Msxml2.XMLHTTP”)}catch(k){try{f=new ActiveXObject(“Microsoft.XMLHTTP”)}catch(u){}}f&&(f.open(“POST”,c+(-1==c.indexOf(“?”)?”?”:”&”)+”url=”+encodeURIComponent(b)),f.setRequestHeader(“Content-Type”,”application/x-www-form-urlencoded”),f.send(a))}}},s=function(){var b={},d=document.getElementsByTagName(“IMG”);if(0==d.length)return{};var a=d[0];if(!(“naturalWidth”in a&&”naturalHeight”in a))return{};for(var c=0;a=d[c];++c){var e=a.getAttribute(“pagespeed_url_hash”);e&&(!(e in b)&&0<a.width&&0<a.height&&0<a.naturalWidth&&0 =b[e].k&&a.height>=b[e].j)&&(b[e]={rw:a.width,rh:a.height,ow:a.naturalWidth,oh:a.naturalHeight})}return b},t=””;h(“pagespeed.CriticalImages.getBeaconData”,function(){return t});h(“pagespeed.CriticalImages.Run”,function(b,d,a,c,e,f){var k=new p(b,d,a,e,f);n=k;c&&m(function(){window.setTimeout(function(){r(k)},0)})});})();pagespeed.CriticalImages.Run(‘/mod_pagespeed_beacon’,’ http://www.consciousowl.com/wp-content/plugins/thrive-visual-editor/shortcodes/templates/thrv_image_load.php&#8217 ;,’3TYopLAIql’,true,false,’NmLWXTsFGWU’);\n//]]> \nYou might want to read the masterful Richard Bolles’ book called “ How To Find Your Mission in Life ” from his  What Color Is Your Parachute? series. \nIf I might paraphrase his key ideas there: \n1)   We are here to celebrate God (Pure Being, Consciousness and Bliss) \n2)   We are here to unconditionally love every sentient being \n3)   We are here to serve the world in our own unique way, addressing the cause that most speaks to us in the field or domain that most delights us.\nConsult close friends to get at key insights into who you are this time around and what your mission might be.\nIf there were one thing that you would change about the world today, what would it be? If there were one field you could work in (whether or not your feel qualified), which would it be?\nI have found the hard way that the truth most readily emerges, not in isolation, but in relationship. Often the people closest to you will see possibilities in you that you never even imagined.\nHow Can You Sustain Your Inner Vision Through Intense Focus? Break your daily routine and pattern enough to really let the light open up within you, most often by going into the forest or by the sea. Take a walk, a hike or swim. Breathe deeply and listen to what might come.\nYour inner vision will come when it comes by the way that it chooses to come. You don’t choose it, it chooses you.\n\n\nClick to Tweet \nIt is the Voice of God . It will literally blow your mind. It will speak to body, soul and spirit simultaneously. You will feel born again.\nRead and study Napoleon Hill’s masterpiece, Think and Grow Rich , and find out how he takes a definite desire, and builds it to a magnificent obsession that drives one’s life.\nNapoleon uses self-suggestion with a definite, concrete goal. The example he gives entails accumulating a specific amount of money. However, Napoleon makes it clear that the same process applies to any goal, even a divine mission to save the world.\nRead and study Beth Jones’ delightful workbook, The Path: Creating Your Mission Statement for Work and for life . The book does exactly that. You not only identify a personal mission in a single sentence, you also end up writing a vision statement of a page or so around what your life will be like three-to-five years hence.\nThe workbook is so designed that you open up your intuition in reading the examples and answering her questions. If you give this book a fair shake, you will definitely not regret it.\nIf you already have your inner vision… then craft a plan on how you are going to bring it to reality. If you are still searching for it… focus your energy now on finding it. And once it comes… you’ll know it… because your body will be flushed with uplifting energy… over and over again.\n**If you have any useful tips or experiences… feel free to share with our community!\nIf You Lose Your Inner Vision, You’ve Lost Your Inner Power appeared first on http://consciousowl.com .",
